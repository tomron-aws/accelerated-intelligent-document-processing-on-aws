# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Optional `{CLASS_AND_ATTRIBUTE_NAMES_AND_DESCRIPTIONS}` placeholder for classification prompts** ([#262](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/262)) — Pattern 2 classification `task_prompt` templates can opt in to a new placeholder that expands, per document type, to the class name, description, **and** schema attribute names. Renders as XML for `multimodalPageLevelClassification` and as a markdown table for `textbasedHolisticClassification`. Cost-neutral by default — only materialized when the template references it, with per-class attribute counts capped (default 50) to keep prompt cost predictable. Useful for schema-rich domains where similarly-named classes have very different extraction schemas. The Web UI Prompt Preview tab renders the substituted attributes for inspection. See [`docs/classification.md`](docs/classification.md#optional-class_and_attribute_names_and_descriptions-placeholder).

- **Cross-account Bedrock invocation via STS AssumeRole** ([#305](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/305)) — IDP processing Lambdas can now route all Bedrock traffic through a centralized "hub" AWS account. Set the new optional `BedrockHubRoleArn` parameter (with optional external-id / session-name) and the stack conditionally adds `sts:AssumeRole` to each Lambda's execution role. STS credentials auto-refresh via `DeferredRefreshableCredentials` so warm Lambdas survive past the 1-hour STS session. Covers the entire pipeline plus discovery, embeddings, Chat with Document, and Agent Companion (incl. Strands sub-agents). Fully additive — leaving the parameter empty preserves prior same-account behavior. **Out of scope:** BDA runtime, Bedrock Knowledge Bases, and `model_finetuning/`. See [`docs/cross-account-bedrock.md`](docs/cross-account-bedrock.md).

- **Distinguish MISSING pages from BLANK fields in extraction output** ([#317](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/317)) — for sparsely-populated multi-section forms where pages may be legitimately omitted, extraction can now distinguish fields whose source page was *present but empty* (BLANK) from those whose source page was *not submitted* (MISSING). Two new optional schema extensions, `x-aws-idp-page-types` and `x-aws-idp-source-page-types`, declare named page sub-types and which page types each property sources from. A regex-based resolver detects present page types, annotates the LLM prompt with `--- PAGE N [PageType] ---` markers, and (when enabled) post-processes the JSON to drop/null fields whose source pages are absent. Output gains optional `page_type_resolution` and `missing_fields_report`. Fully additive; the Document Schema editor adds form widgets for both extensions. See [`docs/missing-page-handling.md`](docs/missing-page-handling.md) and the [demo notebook](notebooks/usecase-specific-examples/multi-page-bank-statement/step3_extraction_with_missing_pages.ipynb).

- **Private (VPC-only) deployment — browser uploads route through the S3 Interface VPC Endpoint** — when `WebUIHosting=ALB`, the ALB nested stack provisions an S3 Interface VPC Endpoint and exposes its regional DNS name as a new `S3VPCEndpointDnsName` output. Web UI presigner Lambdas, `ApiHandlerFunction`, and config/dataset custom resources receive an `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` env var and use virtual-host addressing so SigV4 matches the VPCE DNS. Browser uploads and Lambda S3 traffic stay on the AWS backbone with zero public-internet egress.

- **Bring-Your-Own S3 VPC endpoint** — two new top-level parameters (`S3VpcEndpointIdOverride`, `S3VpcEndpointDnsNameOverride`) let customers with a central network account reuse an existing endpoint instead of having the IDP stack provision one. Both must be set together; CloudFormation `Rules` enforce the pairing.

- **`monitoring` (CloudWatch) Interface VPC Endpoint** — `scripts/vpc-endpoints.yaml` now provisions a CloudWatch Interface VPC Endpoint, gated by the new `CreateMonitoringEndpoint` parameter (default `true`). Required for the `DashboardMerger` custom resource to succeed in private mode. `scripts/check-vpc-endpoints.sh` updated to detect and skip pre-existing endpoints.

- **`LambdaSecurityGroupId` parameter on the ALB nested stack** — when supplied, the ALB S3 VPC Endpoint security group allows inbound 443 from the app Lambda SG so VPC-resident Lambdas can reach S3 through the same endpoint as ALB. Fixes a 5-minute hang in `ConfigurationCopyFunction` caused by SG mismatch.


### Changed

- **ALB nested stack S3 VPC endpoint policy scoped to same-account operations** — the endpoint policy allows a finite set of S3 actions on `arn:${AWS::Partition}:s3:::*` conditioned on `aws:PrincipalAccount` / `aws:ResourceAccount` matching the deployment account. Wildcard resource is necessary to avoid cyclic dependencies on parent-stack buckets; authorization is additionally enforced at the network (SG) and IAM (role + bucket policy) layers. See `docs/deployment-private-network.md`.

- **`scripts/generate_self_signed_cert.sh` uses a short fixed CommonName (`idp-self-signed`) with the full ALB hostname in `subjectAltName`** — internal ALB DNS names often exceed the X.509 64-char CN limit, causing openssl to abort. Modern browsers validate only against SAN, so this is RFC-correct and removes the silent failure.

### Fixed

- **Agentic extraction now supports `:1m` model IDs (1M context window)** ([#312](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/312)) — agentic extraction with `:1m` model ids (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7:1m`) previously failed at ConverseStream with `ValidationException` because the agentic path forwarded the raw id to Strands' `BedrockModel`. `_build_model_config` now strips `:1m` and forwards the `anthropic_beta` header via Strands' `additional_request_fields`, matching the traditional Bedrock path. All `:1m` variants now work.

- **Bedrock Knowledge Base nested stack no longer left in `DELETE_FAILED` on update/delete** ([#315](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/315)) — two reliability fixes in `nested/bedrockkb/template.yaml`:
  - **Reliable `AWS::Bedrock::DataSource` deletion during sync** — the Delete handler now stops in-progress ingestion jobs and polls until terminal status (12-min deadline) before signalling SUCCESS, so CFN can delete the data source cleanly. Always reports SUCCESS on Delete (logs warnings) so a stuck job never blocks stack delete. IAM gains `Stop/Get/ListIngestionJobs`, timeout is 15 min, and ingestion functions `DependsOn` their schedulers to avoid races.
  - **Helper IAM roles now `DeletionPolicy: Retain`** — `DataSourceSchedulerRole` and `StartIngestionJobFunctionRole` are ephemeral helpers; marking them `Retain` decouples nested-stack delete from the deploying principal's `iam:DeleteRole` permission. Defensive fix for session policies that deny `iam:DeleteRole`. Retained roles are inert and can be deleted manually after the stack is gone.

## [0.5.11]

### Added

- **"Update available" indicator in Web UI Deployment Info** — the Deployment Info section of the side nav now shows a small `Update` badge next to the deployed `Version: …` line whenever a newer published template is available on the public artifacts bucket. Hovering the badge opens a popover showing the deployed and latest versions; for **Admin** users, the popover includes a one-click "Update stack in CloudFormation →" link that deep-links to the AWS console with the new template URL pre-filled (review parameters before applying). **Zero-touch by default**: `idp-cli publish` auto-substitutes the new `PublicArtifactsBucket` / `PublicArtifactsPrefix` CloudFormation parameter defaults to point at the bucket and prefix it's publishing to, so customers deploying the published template get the indicator out of the box. Headless / private-network deployments can override `PublicArtifactsBucket=""` to disable the check. The check itself runs in a small Lambda resolver (`getLatestPublishedVersion`) that lists the public bucket via unsigned S3 reads and caches results for 10 minutes. The headless template transformer (`HeadlessTemplateTransformer`) strips the resolver, parameters, and Settings entries so headless / GovCloud builds remain UI-free with zero dangling references.

- **Chat-with-Document enhancements** — the Web UI "Chat with Document" feature has been substantially upgraded:
  - **Async streaming** — responses now stream token-by-token into the chat bubble so large documents and long-context models no longer hit AppSync's 30-second synchronous timeout.
  - **Markdown rendering in assistant replies** — headings, bullet/numbered lists, fenced code blocks, inline code, tables, block quotes, and links render as formatted HTML instead of raw markdown characters. Renders during streaming and at final.
  - **Dedicated `chat` configuration section** — independent from `summarization`, with its own `model`, `system_prompt`, `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`, and `max_tokens`. Backward compatible: configs without a `chat` section fall back to `summarization.*`.
  - **UI model selector on the Chat panel** — per-session model override, populated from the config's model enum; default comes from the document's own config version.
  - **Default chat model is `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-7:1m`** — 1M-context by default so typical multi-hundred-page packets fit without hitting input-token limits. EU and GovCloud presets use their region-appropriate inference profiles.
  - **First-class support for Bedrock model-ID suffixes** — `:1m` (1M-context beta), `:priority` and `:flex` (service tiers) all work end-to-end when selected in the Chat panel dropdown.


### Changed

### Fixed

- **Config validation now checks max_tokens against model limits** — `idp-cli config-validate` now verifies that `max_tokens` is within the model's maximum output token limit, catching invalid configurations like `extraction.max_tokens: 16000` with `us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` (max 10,000 tokens) before deployment. New `_validate_max_tokens()` function checks all services (extraction, classification, assessment, summarization) against model-specific limits loaded from `config_library/model_config_limits.yaml`: Claude 4.x (64,000), Claude 3.x (8,192), Amazon Nova (10,000), default (4,096). Added `get_model_max_output_tokens()` utility to `bedrock/model_utils.py` for use by CLI validation only (Lambda functions continue to use hardcoded limits for runtime defense-in-depth).

- **Empty content array handling across all LLM services** — LLMs occasionally return empty content arrays (`content: []`) instead of the expected text response, causing `IndexError: list index out of range` when accessing `content[0]`. All affected services now check for empty arrays before accessing elements and raise descriptive errors with task context. Applied to classification (page-level and holistic), summarization, bedrock client helper, and model finetuning inference. Added 11 unit tests in `test_empty_content_array.py` covering all edge cases (empty, single-element, multi-element arrays).

- **LLM array wrapping in extraction and assessment services** — LLMs occasionally return single-element arrays `[{...}]` instead of objects `{...}` when generating JSON responses, causing Pydantic validation errors (`Input should be a valid dictionary [type=dict_type, input_value=[{...}], input_type=list]`). All affected services now automatically detect and unwrap single-element arrays with a warning log, while multi-element arrays are rejected with a clear error message. Applied to standard extraction, agentic extraction, assessment service, and granular assessment service.

## [0.5.10]

### Added

- **Enhanced config validation** — `idp-cli config-validate` now validates Bedrock model IDs against `pricing.yaml` and checks that custom `task_prompts` include required placeholders (e.g. `{DOCUMENT_TEXT}`, `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}`) across all pipeline sections. Runs automatically on `config-upload` (use `--no-validate` to skip).

- **`idp-cli discover --model-id` flag** — override the Bedrock model used by `idp-cli discover` for a single invocation (e.g. `--model-id us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`). Applies to all discovery modes; backward-compatible. ([#309](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/309))

- **Bedrock circuit breaker** — a CFN-parameterized circuit breaker that pauses new workflow starts when Bedrock is unhealthy and auto-recovers once the service comes back, so transient Bedrock outages no longer burn through SQS retries or leave documents half-processed. Off by default for full backward compatibility.
  - New `circuit_breaker_manager` Lambda owns state transitions (`CLOSED` / `OPEN` / `HALF_OPEN`) in the existing `ConcurrencyTable`. Triggered by CloudWatch Alarms on Bedrock error metrics (via SNS) and by an EventBridge-scheduled health check that promotes `OPEN → HALF_OPEN` after `RECOVERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. `workflow_tracker` closes the breaker after the first successful probe.
  - `queue_processor` gates new work before incrementing the concurrency counter; `OPEN` messages are redelivered by SQS (with `ChangeMessageVisibility` extended to the recovery timeout to avoid DLQ churn), DDB errors fail open.
  - All state transitions use conditional DDB writes so concurrent alarm/workflow updates cannot clobber each other. `failure_count` is preserved across `OPEN → HALF_OPEN`; manual reset zeros counters and clears `last_error`.
  - Operator hooks: manual `reset` / `get_state` invocations, optional customer Lambda invoked via `ERROR_HANDLER_ARN`, CloudWatch metrics (`CircuitBreaker{Opened,HalfOpen,Closed}`), and `AlertsTopic` notifications.
  - New CFN parameters (all default off): `EnableCircuitBreaker`, `CircuitBreakerRecoveryTimeoutSeconds`, `CircuitBreakerErrorHandlerArn`. Unit tests cover alarm/health-check/manual/race-loss branches.
  - **Web UI visibility & admin controls** — document list header shows a live status badge (green/blue/red with `lastError` tooltip) via an AppSync subscription; clicking opens a details panel. Admin-group users additionally get **Pause / Resume / Probe** buttons (each requires a reason, persisted and broadcast). All automatic transitions publish to the subscription so the badge updates within ~1s. Hidden entirely when `CircuitBreakerEnabled=false`. Backed by new AppSync ops (`getCircuitBreakerStatus`, `pause/resume/probeCircuitBreaker`, `onCircuitBreakerStatusChange`) and a new resolver Lambda that enforces Admin authorization at both the schema and resolver layers.
  - Docs: `docs/circuit-breaker.md` and `src/lambda/circuit_breaker_manager/README.md`.


### Changed

- **Replaced DSR with open-source SRT security scanning tool** — Migrated from the deprecated internal DSR tool to the open-source [Sample Security Review Tool (SRT)](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-security-review-tool). GitLab CI/CD now runs SRT on MRs targeting `develop` and fails the pipeline on findings. New Makefile targets: `make srt`, `make srt-setup`, `make srt-scan`, `make srt-fix`.


### Fixed

- **SRT now uses `--no-license-update`** to prevent it from automatically rewriting source file license headers during security scans.

- **Agentic extraction with Claude Opus 4.7 no longer fails with `top_p is deprecated`** — the Claude 4.7+ enablement in v0.5.7 fixed the traditional Bedrock path but missed the Strands-based agentic path (`idp_common/extraction/agentic_idp.py`), which still forwarded `top_p` to ConverseStream. Both paths now share the same `is_claude_4_7_model` detection and omit deprecated inference params. ([#304](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/304))

- **`idp-cli discover` silently ignored mismatched ground truth files** — previously a filename-stem mismatch between `-d` and `-g` only produced a warning and ran discovery without ground truth. Now: single-doc + single-GT invocations are paired by position (no filename match required); batch-mode mismatches or duplicate GT stems fail with exit `1` and a clear message. ([#310](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/310))

- **Web UI "View Source" failed for PDFs and other docs after the v0.5.9 CSP hardening** — three fixes in `FileViewer`: (1) pass an `s3://bucket/key` URI to `getFileContents` instead of relying on the build-time `VITE_AWS_REGION` env var; (2) render PDFs in an `<iframe>` instead of `<object>` so they're allowed under the hardened `object-src 'none'` CSP; (3) drop the `sandbox` attribute on the PDF iframe only (Chrome's built-in PDF viewer is blocked when sandboxed; non-PDF iframes keep their sandbox). Added a fallback "Open PDF in a new tab" link.

- **Private ALB deployment broken when stack name had uppercase characters** — the ALB DNS name is case-preserving, but browser `Origin` headers, Cognito `redirect_uri` matching, and the ALB url-rewrite regex all expected lowercase, so CORS preflights, OAuth callbacks, and the `/` → `/index.html` rewrite all failed. Fixed by lowercasing the ALB URL in every CFN consumer (new `GetLowercaseAlbUrl` custom resource reusing the existing `GetDomainLambda`), lowercasing the Amplify redirect URL in `aws-exports.js`, and broadening the ALB rewrite regex from `^/$` to `^/` so OAuth query strings don't break the match. CloudFront deployments unaffected. ([#303](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/303))

## [0.5.9]

### Added

- **Policy Discovery & Rule Validation Policy Classification**: Upload a regulatory document (e.g., an NCCI Medicare policy manual) and automatically extract structured validation rules from it. A new "Policy Discovery" tab in the Discovery page walks you through the process, and the extracted rules feed directly into the rule validation workflow.
  - A new policy classification step runs before rule validation, matching each document against your configured `policy_classes` using regex patterns on document names and page content. Only matching policy rules are evaluated, so unrelated rules are skipped automatically.
  - The configuration key `rule_classes` has been renamed to `policy_classes` for clarity. Existing configs will need to update this key.
  - The Schema Builder now has dedicated support for editing policy classes with policy-specific labels, and extraction-only settings are hidden when editing policy schemas.
  - A "Policy Discovery" section has been added to Discovery Configuration in the UI, letting you choose the model, temperature, and prompts used for Policy Discovery.
  - The legacy `rule-extraction` configuration preset has been removed. Use **Policy Discovery** on the Discovery tab instead — it writes extracted rules directly into the active config's `policy_classes`.

- **Document-level Download button on the Document Details page** — A new **Download** dropdown in the Document Details header lets users pull every output artifact for a document in a single click, packaged as a ZIP. Three scopes are offered:
  - **Download All (ZIP)** — document attributes, metering, summary, evaluation & rule-validation reports, per-section predictions, baselines (when available), per-page text/confidence, and optionally per-page images and/or the source document (checkboxes).
  - **Download Predictions (ZIP)** — all section result JSONs plus a self-describing `manifest.json`.
  - **Download Baselines (ZIP)** — all baseline section result JSONs (shown only when an evaluation baseline is available).
  - **Bucket-mirrored ZIP layout** — files are organised under top-level `output/`, `baseline/`, and `input/` folders that preserve the real S3 key structure, so the archive can be diffed with a direct `aws s3 sync` of the same buckets.


- **Headless REST API mode with VPC-secured deployment for GovCloud** — a first-party Jobs REST API for programmatic document submission and status tracking, plus an optional VPC-secured deployment that keeps the API off the public internet. Makes end-to-end GovCloud deployment viable without the UI/AppSync stack, and gives Commercial customers a supported alternative to direct S3 uploads for machine-to-machine integrations.
  - **Jobs REST API** (new `src/lambda/api_handler/`, `src/lambda/job_tracker/`, `src/lambda/batch_pre_processor/`):
    - `POST /jobs` — creates a job record and returns a presigned POST URL for the input zip (1-hour expiry, content-type pinned to `application/zip`, 5 GB content-length cap).
    - `GET /jobs/{job_id}` — returns overall status (`PENDING_UPLOAD` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `SUCCEEDED` / `PARTIALLY_SUCCEEDED` / `FAILED` / `ABORTED`), per-file status map, and — on success — a presigned GET URL for `results.zip`. `SUCCEEDED` is gated on `results.zip` actually being present in the output bucket to avoid racing callers into a 404.
    - OAuth2 `client_credentials` auth via a dedicated Cognito User Pool + Resource Server (`idp-api/jobs.read`, `idp-api/jobs.write` scopes). Separate from the existing web-UI Cognito pool.
    - **Per-client job ownership (M1):** each job records its creating Cognito principal (`sub` / `client_id`) as `CreatedBy`. `GET /jobs/{job_id}` returns **HTTP 404** (not 403, to avoid existence-leak) when the caller's principal doesn't match the job's owner. Legacy job records written before this field existed remain readable by any authenticated caller. **Behavior change:** `GET /jobs/{job_id}` on a non-existent job now correctly returns 404; previously returned 400 (a pre-existing response-code bug in the API handler).
  - **Private API Gateway + bastion tunneling:**
    - `AWS::Serverless::Api` with `EndpointConfiguration: PRIVATE` bound to a customer-supplied `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId` and a resource policy that denies all traffic not originating from that VPC endpoint.
    - Optional `DeployBastionHost=true` spins up an SSM-reachable `t3.small` EC2 with IMDSv2 required, encrypted EBS via a dedicated rotating KMS key, and no inbound SSH. `scripts/bastion.sh <STACK_NAME>` sets up a local SSH tunnel for dev-time API access; `scripts/get_api_token.sh <STACK_NAME>` fetches an OAuth2 bearer token.
  - **Safe zip extraction in `batch_pre_processor` (M2 + M3):**
    - `MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES` (default 20 GiB, env-configurable) and `MAX_ENTRIES` (default 10,000) bounds checked **pre-flight** before any uploads begin. Bound violations write a terminal `FAILED` marker to the job record so the API surfaces the failure.
    - Per-entry streaming via `zipfile.ZipFile.open()` + `s3.upload_fileobj()` — no more loading whole entries into Lambda memory.
    - Per-entry failure isolation — one bad file is marked `FAILED` and the rest of the batch still uploads and advances through the pipeline; the job converges to `PARTIALLY_SUCCEEDED` / `FAILED` / `SUCCEEDED` as appropriate.
  - **New CFN parameters** (all default to off/empty, fully backward-compatible):
    - `EnableHeadless` (bool) — turns on the Jobs REST API.
    - `DeployInVPC` (bool) — places all IDP Lambdas in customer-supplied private subnets with a customer-supplied security group.
    - `VpcId`, `PrivateSubnetIds`, `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId`, `LambdaSecurityGroupId`, `ApiStageName` — customer-supplied networking.
    - `DeployBastionHost`, `BastionHostSubnetId`, `BastionHostSecurityGroupId` — optional dev-access bastion.
    - **CloudFormation console UX** - the 11 new parameters are grouped into two dedicated `AWS::CloudFormation::Interface` sections ("Headless API Deployment (required for GovCloud)" and "Headless API Deployment - Bastion Host (optional, requires VPC Secured Mode)") with friendlier `ParameterLabels` and rewritten `Description` text. Each description now explicitly states when the parameter is required, what the default behavior is (no Jobs API / no Lambda VPC placement / no bastion EC2 unless explicitly enabled), and which companion parameters it depends on. Ensures Quick-Start users who click the README's "Launch Stack" button see clear opt-in sections rather than assuming the bastion host or Jobs API is always deployed.
  - **CFN fail-fast validation (H1)** — new `Rules:` block entries catch misconfiguration at stack create / update time with clear `AssertDescription` errors, instead of failing deep in resource provisioning:
    - `HeadlessRequiresVPC` — `EnableHeadless=true` requires `DeployInVPC=true` + non-empty `VpcId` / `ApiGatewayVpcEndpointId` / `LambdaSecurityGroupId`.
    - `BastionRequiresVPC` — `DeployBastionHost=true` requires `DeployInVPC=true` + non-empty bastion subnet / SG.
  - Plus **defense-in-depth** on the two API-gated Lambdas: `VpcConfig` is wrapped in `!If [DeployInVPC, …, AWS::NoValue]` so even if the Rules block is ever relaxed, the Lambdas won't fail to create on empty `!Ref` values.
  - **CLI (`idp-cli`):**
    - `--headless` now auto-sets the `EnableHeadless=true` stack parameter — they were always used together.
    - `idp-cli deploy --headless --from-code . --stack-name <NEW>` no longer requires `--admin-email`. The headless template strips the UI Cognito pool and has no `AdminEmail` parameter; passing it through produced `ValidationError: Parameters: [AdminEmail] do not exist in the template`. Now skipped and dropped with a note. Non-headless new-stack creation still requires `--admin-email`.
  - **Publish pipeline fixes that make headless-to-GovCloud deploys work:**
    - `cfn-lint` in headless mode now lints `idp-headless.yaml` and skips commercial-only templates (`idp-main.yaml`, `nested/appsync`), which contain `AWS::AppSync::*` / `AWS::CloudFront::*` resources that don't exist in `us-gov-*` regions. Fixes `E3006 Resource type … does not exist`.
    - E/W classification in `_validate_cfn_lint` now uses `^E\d{4}` / `^W\d{4}` regex anchors. Previously the substring `":E"` also matched resource prefixes like `AWS::EC2::`, inflating warning-severity lines to errors.
    - `WorkflowStateChangeRule` JobTracker target moved from a conditional `Arn` field (flagged `E3003 'Arn' is a required property`) to a conditional full-target dict via `!If`.
  - **Documentation:**
    - New `docs/govcloud-batch-api.md` — REST API reference with schemas, OAuth flow, bastion tunneling setup, and an Authorization model section covering per-client ownership and multi-client behavior.
    - New `docs/govcloud-architecture.md`, `docs/govcloud-operations.md`, `docs/vpc-secured-mode.md`.
    - Overhauled `docs/govcloud-deployment.md` with a deployment-variant matrix (Vanilla / Headless API / Headless + VPC / Headless + VPC + Bastion).
  - **End-to-end test script:** `scripts/e2e_test_headless.py <STACK_NAME> <PATH_TO_FILE>` exercises the full flow (OAuth → POST /jobs → presigned upload → status poll → download results).

- **Managed configuration upload rejection** — `idp-cli config upload` now rejects configuration files with `managed: true` to prevent users from accidentally creating stack-managed configurations that would be overwritten on stack updates. All user-uploaded configurations automatically have `managed: false` set, ensuring they persist across stack lifecycle events.

### Fixed

- **Evaluation markdown/report rendering resilience** — two defensive fixes that keep evaluation and test-results pages from crashing when upstream data is non-numeric or empty.

### Security

Hardening response to security review - Highlights:

- **Stored XSS defense-in-depth (frontend).** Introduced
  `SafeMarkdown` wrapper (`src/ui/src/components/common/SafeMarkdown.tsx`)
  that pairs `rehype-raw` with `rehype-sanitize` using an allow-list
  schema (retains `<details>`/`<summary>`, custom `<documentid>`,
  tables, code blocks, and a narrow `white-space: pre-line` style
  pattern; strips `<script>`, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs,
  `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`). Migrated all six legacy
  `ReactMarkdown + rehypeRaw` call sites across
  `MarkdownViewer.tsx`, `DocumentsQueryLayout.tsx`,
  `TextDisplay.tsx`, `AgentChatLayout.tsx`, and `AgentToolComponent.tsx`.
- **Stored XSS fix in Knowledge Base resolver (backend).**
  `query_knowledgebase_resolver` now HTML-escapes citation snippets,
  document titles, and URLs via `html.escape()` before embedding them
  in the rendered markdown.
- **Chat session ownership enforced.** `getChatMessages`
  (`get_agent_chat_messages_resolver`) now verifies that the calling
  Cognito user owns the requested `sessionId` by looking up
  `(userId, sessionId)` in `ChatSessionsTable`. Can be temporarily
  disabled via `ENFORCE_CHAT_SESSION_OWNERSHIP=false` env var for
  legacy-session migration. Fails closed on DynamoDB errors.
- **S3 URI allow-list in `getFileContents`.** The resolver now
  rejects any `s3Uri` whose bucket is not one of the IDP stack's
  configured buckets, preventing use as a generic S3-read gadget.
  Also fixes a latent bucket-name parsing bug and validates the
  URI scheme.
- **Log sanitization utility.** New
  `idp_common.utils.log_sanitizer.sanitize_event_for_logging()`
  deep-copies and redacts Cognito claims, identity blobs, auth
  tokens, and API keys from events before they are emitted to
  CloudWatch. Truncates common document-content fields to 500
  characters. Applied to `reprocess_document_resolver`,
  `query_knowledgebase_resolver`, and `get_agent_chat_messages_resolver`
  as reference integrations (rollout to remaining resolvers is tracked
  for a follow-up release). 15 unit tests added.
- **CSP hardening (Phase 1).** Tightened CloudFront
  `SecurityHeadersPolicy`: `object-src 'none'` (was
  `'self' blob: data: https:`), `connect-src` restricted to AWS
  service hostnames (was `https:`). `unsafe-eval` / `unsafe-inline`
  removal deferred pending Monaco-editor compatibility verification.
- **False-positive documentation.** Added explanatory comments and
  `nosec` justifications for:
  - Jinja2 autoescape disabled in `discovery_agent.py`
    (templates produce LLM prompts, not HTML).
  - Unsafe `yaml.load` findings in
    `scripts/sdlc/validate_service_role_permissions.py` and
    `lib/idp_sdk/idp_sdk/_core/publish.py` (both use
    `CFNLoader`/`CFLoader` subclassing `yaml.SafeLoader`; input is
    developer-committed CloudFormation templates, not user input).
  - SQL injection in `test_results_resolver` Athena queries (every
    interpolation is gated by `_validate_sql_input()` with a strict
    allow-list regex).

## [0.5.8]


### Added

- **Excluded-class feature — skip static instruction / legal / boilerplate pages** — Government forms and similar packages often bundle static informational pages (legal warnings, fee instructions, tax notices, oaths) alongside the pages that carry applicant data. Mark a document class with `x-aws-idp-exclude-from-processing: true` and all downstream stages (extraction, assessment, summarization, rule validation, evaluation) skip sections classified as that class — making **zero LLM calls** on boilerplate pages.
  - Optional `x-aws-idp-exclusion-reason` ("instructions", "legal", "cover-page", …) surfaces as a grey **`Skipped: <reason>`** badge in the UI Sections panel and as an **"Excluded Sections (Not Evaluated)"** table in the evaluation markdown report.
  - Configurable via the **UI Configuration Editor** → Document Schema → select a document-type class → "Exclude from Processing" checkbox + "Exclusion Reason" input.
  - New end-to-end sample config at `config_library/unified/ds11-passport-application/` with a matching DS-11 U.S. Passport Application PDF fixture and a standalone demo notebook (`notebooks/usecase-specific-examples/ds11-passport-application/`).
  - Additive: classes without the new flag behave exactly as before.
  - See `docs/classification.md#excluding-static-pages-eg-instructions-legal-boilerplate`.

### Changed

- **UI dependency cleanup — eliminated 11 of 12 npm deprecation warnings** — Replaced deprecated `@aws-sdk/*` packages with `@smithy/*` equivalents, removed unused Babel plugins, migrated ESLint 8→9 (flat config), upgraded Prettier 2→3, and upgraded jsdom 26→29. Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json`. Also added `caughtErrors: 'none'` to ESLint config to stop flagging unused catch clause variables. Added `FORCE=1` arg to `make ui-lint` to force re-run despite checksum match.

- **Headless deployment documentation generalized** — headless mode is no longer documented as a GovCloud-only capability. New `docs/headless-deployment.md` is the canonical guide covering headless deployment for both Commercial and GovCloud regions (API-only / pipeline integrations, organizational restrictions on UI-layer services, cost optimization, and required for GovCloud).

## [0.5.7]

### Added

- **Claude Opus 4.7 Model Support** — Added `anthropic.claude-opus-4-7` (and `:1m` context variant) across all `us`, `eu`, and `global` inference profiles. Includes unified template enums, UI model dropdowns, cachepoint support, EU region mappings, pricing entries, and documentation updates.

- **Add Documents to Existing Test Sets** — New "Add Documents" action in Test Studio allows incrementally adding documents (with ground truth) to an existing test set. Supports both "From Existing Files" (S3 pattern) and "From Upload" (ZIP) sources. Key features:
  - **Automatic baseline filtering**: When using the Input Bucket, files without matching baseline/ground truth data are automatically excluded rather than failing the operation, with a result message reporting counts (e.g., "Added 8 of 12 files (4 excluded - no baseline data)")
  - **Time filter**: Optional "Modified after" filter with presets (Last 1 hour, 4 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) and a custom date/time picker, available in both new test set creation and add-documents flows
  - **Idempotent**: Re-adding an existing document overwrites it; file counts are always recounted from S3 for accuracy
  - **UPDATING status**: Test sets show a transient "Updating..." badge while documents are being added

- **Creating Custom Test Sets Guide** — New tutorial-style documentation (`docs/creating-custom-test-sets.md`) walking through the end-to-end workflow for creating custom test sets with ground truth data from scratch: configure for max accuracy, discover document schema, process samples, review/edit predictions, save evaluation baselines, register test sets, and run comparative test executions to evaluate cost vs. accuracy tradeoffs. Referenced from `docs/demo-videos.md`.
  
- **Configuration Version Tracking Across All Analytics Tables** — Added `config_version` field to all analytics tables (metering, document_evaluations, section_evaluations, attribute_evaluations, and document_sections_*) to enable comprehensive tracking and analytics per configuration version. All Glue tables now include a `config_version` column, and all Parquet files store the configuration version used for each document. Enables direct filtering and comparison queries without complex JOINs - users can query "show me W2 documents processed with config v2.1" or "compare accuracy for configs v2.0 vs v2.1" with simple WHERE clauses. Supports cost analysis, A/B testing, quality comparison, and data lineage tracking. Documents without a config version default to "default".

### Fixed

- **Incorrect global inference profile IDs for Knowledge Base model** — Fixed `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-v1:0` and `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-v1:0` in the `KnowledgeBaseModelId` CloudFormation parameter dropdown. These shortened IDs were invalid and caused `ResourceNotFoundException` when used. Corrected to `global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0` and `global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0` per the [AWS Bedrock inference profiles documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html). ([#286](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/286))

- **Application Inference Profile IAM permissions** — Added `application-inference-profile/*` ARN pattern to `bedrock:InvokeModel` IAM policies across all templates (root, appsync, multi-doc-discovery, and sample templates). PR #236 previously fixed only `patterns/unified/template.yaml`; this completes the fix for all Lambda execution roles. Also added `bedrock:GetInferenceProfile` read permission to support prompt caching resolution. ([#272](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/272))

- **Prompt caching with application inference profiles** — Fixed `<<CACHEPOINT>>` tags being stripped when using Bedrock application inference profile ARNs as model IDs. The cachepoint check now resolves inference profile ARNs to their underlying foundation model via the `GetInferenceProfile` API, enabling prompt caching for profiles that wrap supported models (Claude, Nova). Results are cached to avoid repeated API calls, with graceful fallback if the API call fails. ([#272](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/272))

- **Chat with document uses hardcoded US model ID** — Fixed "Chat with document" feature failing in non-US regions (e.g., `eu-west-1`) with "The provided model identifier is invalid" error. The backend Lambda's `get_summarization_model()` fallback was hardcoded to `us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`. Added `get_default_model_for_region()` helper that selects the appropriate region-prefixed model (`eu.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` for EU, `us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` for US) based on `AWS_REGION`. ([#282](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/282))

- **BDA activation modal checking wrong version config** — Fixed the "Activate Version" flow incorrectly checking the *currently selected* version's `use_bda` flag (`mergedConfig?.use_bda`) instead of the *target* version being activated. This caused the BDA sync confirmation modal to appear (or not appear) based on the wrong version's configuration. The fix fetches and inspects the target version's actual config before deciding whether to show the modal. Also added a `fetchVersions()` refresh after BDA sync operations to keep BDA project ARN metadata up to date in the versions list.

### Changed
- **MCP Cognito Client Rename (BREAKING CHANGE)** — Renamed Cognito User Pool app client names for clarity:
  - `external-app-client` → `user-authorized-mcp-client` (3-legged OAuth / authorization code flow)
  - `mcp-connector-client` → `machine-authorized-mcp-client` (2-legged OAuth / client credentials flow)
  - Added `EnableTokenRevocation` and `PreventUserExistenceErrors` to machine-authorized client
  - Removed duplicate `QuickM2MClient` resource and outputs
  - Updated stack output descriptions with OAuth flow types and use-case context
  - **⚠️ Upgrade note**: Any existing deployment using the current credentials (MCP Connector instances, QuickSight integrations, external apps) will break after a stack update and will need to be reconfigured. After updating, retrieve new client IDs and secrets from CloudFormation outputs and update your MCP Connector and external app configurations.

## [0.5.6]

### Added

- **Test Studio CLI Commands** — `idp-cli test-result` to retrieve test results with automatic evaluation triggering and `--wait`/`--output-dir` options, and `idp-cli test-compare` to compare multiple test runs with JSON/CSV export. See `docs/idp-cli.md`.

- **Custom Model Fine-Tuning** — Fine-tune Amazon Nova 2 models (Lite and Pro) for document classification and extraction using your own labeled Test Sets. The end-to-end workflow — validate data, generate training data, train via Bedrock, and deploy an on-demand custom model endpoint — is driven from a new **Custom Models** page in the Web UI. Custom models can then be selected in any configuration version for classification and/or extraction. Available to Admin and Author roles. **Note:** currently requires deployment in `us-east-1`. See `docs/custom-model-finetuning.md`.
  
- **External SAML/OIDC Identity Provider Federation** — Optional support for federating authentication through an external SAML or OIDC identity provider via Amazon Cognito. Enables organizations to use existing enterprise identity providers (PingOne, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, etc.) for single sign-on. All federation functionality is opt-in through 12 new CloudFormation parameters — leaving them empty results in zero additional resources and identical behavior to existing Cognito-native authentication. See `docs/external-idp.md`.

- **Private Network Deployment** — Deploy the IDP Accelerator in fully private / air-gapped environments. New `AppSyncVisibility` parameter (`GLOBAL` | `PRIVATE`) makes the AppSync API accessible only from inside the VPC. All processing Lambda functions (21 across 3 templates) are conditionally placed in customer VPC subnets with an HTTPS-only security group. Includes a separate VPC endpoint CloudFormation template (`scripts/vpc-endpoints.yaml`) with 16 interface endpoints (AppSync, Bedrock, SQS, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, SSM, KMS, STS, Textract, and more) and per-endpoint creation flags to skip pre-existing endpoints. All features are off by default — existing deployments are completely unaffected. See `docs/deployment-private-network.md`.

- **Enhanced Information Panels** — Added comprehensive help content to the Information (ⓘ) panel on every page in the Web UI. Each panel now includes a feature summary, list of key capabilities, and "Learn more" links to relevant docs-site documentation pages. Created new panels for 8 pages that previously had none (Pricing, Capacity Planning, Custom Models, Discovery, User Management, Test Studio), and enriched the existing 7 panels with fuller descriptions and documentation links.
  
### Changed

- **Removed Claude Sonnet 4:1m and Sonnet 4.5:1m model variants** — The 1M context window beta for Claude Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0:1m`) and Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0:1m`) is being retired effective April 30, 2026. These `:1m` model variants have been removed from all enum lists, UI dropdowns, quota code mappings, pricing, and documentation. Users needing 1M context windows should migrate to Claude Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6:1m`), where the 1M context window is generally available (GA).

- **Default extraction model updated** to `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` (was `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`) in system defaults.
- **Error Analyzer system prompt improvements** — Added strategy for large batches, priority ordering, and error classification guidance.
- **Error Analyzer settings** — Replaced duplicate inline cache with the shared cache from the common monitoring package.
- **Shared CloudWatch Logs** — Extracted log search logic from the Error Analyzer into a reusable library in the common monitoring package.
- **Enhanced CI/CD Automated Testing** — Enhanced GitLab CI/CD pipeline smoke tests with parallel test execution (8 tests running concurrently with fail-fast behavior), deeper verification (extraction fields, classification results, rule statistics), and added new tests: multi-document concurrent processing (Test 4), Test Studio evaluation with metrics validation (Test 7), agentic extraction with large table validation - 532 fund items (Test 8), single-document discovery (Test 9), and multi-document discovery (Test 10).

### Fixed

- **Fixed** agentic extraction crash (`TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__`) when table parsing stats contain `None` values for `avg_confidence` or `parse_success_rate`.
- **Fixed** agentic extraction `map_table_to_schema` producing phantom empty rows from non-matching tables (e.g. account_summary rows prepended to transaction_details), causing list item ordering to be shifted by several positions.
- **Error Analyzer model selection** — The agent was using the Chat Companion's model instead of its own configured model.
- **Error Analyzer log processing** — Fixed early termination that stopped searching after the first Lambda function with errors; now searches all relevant log groups.
- **Error Analyzer log truncation** — Fixed handling of long log messages to trim them rather than skip them entirely.
- **Reprocess from Document Details** — Fixed config version not being passed when reprocessing a document from the Document Details page (showed "N/A" instead of the selected version).
- **Analytics Agent date awareness** — Injected current UTC date/time into the analytics agent system prompt so the LLM can correctly handle relative-time queries (e.g., "show me today's documents", "what was processed this week").

## [0.5.5]

### Added

- **Multi-Document Discovery** — New capability to automatically discover document classes from a collection of documents. Instead of manually defining document schemas one at a time, users point to a folder of mixed documents and the system automatically identifies document types, clusters similar documents, generates JSON Schemas with field definitions for each type, and saves them to a configuration version — ready for immediate use in the processing pipeline. Available from the Web UI, CLI (`idp-cli discover-multidoc`), and SDK (`client.discovery.run_multi_doc()`).
  - **Web UI**: New "Multi-Document" tab on the Discovery page with job submission form (config version selector, bucket selector, S3 prefix input, zip upload), jobs table with search/filter/sort/pagination, and detailed job results page with pipeline progress, expandable JSON schemas, config deep-links, and Quality Review Report
  - **CLI**: `idp-cli discover-multidoc --dir ./samples/ -o ./schemas/` with Rich progress bars, results table, and reflection report
  - **SDK**: `client.discovery.run_multi_doc(document_dir="./samples/")` with typed `MultiDocDiscoveryResult` response model
  - **Two Input Modes**: S3 path (select bucket + prefix), zip upload (presigned URL), or local directory (CLI/SDK)
  - **Configuration Integration**: Discovered classes are saved directly to the selected config version's `classes` array in DynamoDB, immediately available for document processing without manual schema creation

- **Prompt Preview** — New "Prompt Preview" tab in the Configuration page lets you preview the actual prompts sent to the LLM for each processing step (Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization). Config-derived placeholders are filled in with real values (class names, cleaned JSON Schema), while document-specific placeholders are shown as highlighted markers. Includes token estimates, copy-to-clipboard, and a substitution details panel showing the exact schema sent to the LLM. Helps optimize document class schemas and prompt templates.

- **IDP CLI `chat` Command & SDK `ChatOperation`** — Interactive Agent Companion Chat from the terminal and programmatic SDK access. Runs the same multi-agent orchestrator as the Web UI locally, with real-time streaming and multi-turn conversation support. Includes Analytics Agent, Error Analyzer Agent, and optionally Code Intelligence Agent (`--enable-code-intelligence`). Available as `idp-cli chat --stack-name <stack>` for interactive use, `--prompt` flag for single-shot scripting, and `client.chat.send_message()` in the Python SDK. See `docs/idp-cli.md#chat`.

- **Per-Class Extraction Model Override** — New JSON Schema extension allows overriding the global `extraction.model` on a per-document-class basis. Useful when certain document types benefit from a different model (e.g., a more powerful model for complex financial forms, a faster/cheaper model for simple documents). Classes without the extension continue to use the global default. Works with both traditional and agentic extraction modes. See `docs/extraction.md` — Per-Class Extraction Model Override section.

- **Chandra OCR Lambda Hook Sample** — New `GENAIIDP-chandra-ocr-hook` sample in `samples/lambda-hook-inference/` that integrates [Datalab Chandra OCR 2](https://github.com/datalab-to/chandra) with the LambdaHook feature for high-quality OCR. Supports 90+ languages, math, tables, forms, and handwriting. Uses the Datalab hosted async API (`/api/v1/convert`) with configurable output format (markdown/json/html) and conversion mode (fast/balanced/accurate). Includes standalone SAM template, local test script, and deployment instructions. See `docs/lambda-hook-inference.md` — Chandra OCR Integration section.

- **Average Cost Per Page Metric** — Test results and test comparison views now display an "Avg Cost/Page" metric, calculated from total cost and page counts in the cost breakdown. Also included in CSV and JSON exports from the comparison view.

- **Wildcard pattern support for delete-documents** — `idp-cli delete-documents` and `client.batch.delete_documents()` now accept a `--pattern` / `pattern` parameter for fnmatch-style wildcard matching (e.g. `"batch-123/*.pdf"`, `"*invoice*"`). Combines with `--status-filter` to delete e.g. all failed invoices across batches.

- **Agentic Extraction Hardening** — Improved robustness, observability, and table parsing for agentic extraction:
  - Pre-flight OCR & schema analysis with adaptive guidance strength (RECOMMENDED → STRONGLY_RECOMMENDED → MANDATORY) ensures table parsing tool is used for large tables
  - Deterministic Markdown table parser with lookahead recovery, auto-merge of split tables, and configurable `max_empty_line_gap`
  - Post-extraction completeness validation against schema constraints with detailed shortfall reporting
  - Processing report with tool usage decisions, completeness checks, and root cause diagnostics (new UI tab + CloudWatch logs)
  - Thread-safe state management via `contextvars.ContextVar`; deprecated review agent (config fields preserved as no-ops)
  - Bug fixes: `patch_buffer_data` slice correction, confidence assessment loop fix, row-based parse success metric, NoneType guard in completeness check

### Fixed

- **Headless deployment fails with `ConfigurationPreset` AllowedValues error and `GraphQLApi.Arn` reference error** — Added `lending-package-sample-govcloud` to the base template AllowedValues and ConfigurationMap, and auto-detect GovCloud region (`us-gov-*`) for headless template transform instead of missing or hardcoded flag. Also added Discovery resources (BlueprintOptimization, MultiDocDiscovery, DiscoveryProcessor, etc.) to headless removal list to fix `GraphQLApi.Arn` unresolved reference error.

- **`delete-documents` fails with DynamoDB errors** — Fixed two bugs in `get_documents_by_batch()`: (1) passing empty `ExpressionAttributeNames={}` when no status filter caused `ValidationException`, and (2) using low-level DynamoDB client type descriptors (`{"S": "..."}`) with the high-level Table resource caused `begins_with` operand type mismatch. Rewrote to use the high-level `Table.scan()` API with `boto3.dynamodb.conditions.Attr`.

## [0.5.4]

### Added

- **MLflow Experiment Tracking Integration** — Optional integration with Amazon SageMaker MLflow for automated test run logging. When enabled (`EnableMLflow=true`), every Test Studio run automatically logs metrics (accuracy, cost, field-level scores), configuration parameters (model IDs, temperatures, inference settings), and artifacts (full config snapshots, class definitions, cost breakdowns) to an MLflow tracking server. Fire-and-forget async invocation — never blocks or delays test results. Zero resources created when disabled. See `docs/mlflow-integration.md`.

- **BDA Blueprint Optimization** — Automatically improves BDA extraction accuracy using the `InvokeBlueprintOptimizationAsync` API. When discovery includes a ground truth file and `enable_blueprint_optimization: true` is set, the system optimizes the BDA blueprint by comparing extraction results against ground truth, evaluates before/after metrics, and updates the blueprint schema if improved. Disabled by default. See `docs/discovery.md` — Blueprint Optimization section.

- **idp_common API Reference & Documentation** — Added `docs/idpcommon-api-reference.md` covering all 22 modules, created 6 missing module READMEs (discovery, schema, image, s3, utils, metrics), updated core data model docs to match current code, fixed `IDPConfig` lazy-loading bug in `__init__.py`, and integrated into docs-site sidebar.

- **Consolidated publish and headless deploy into `idp-cli`** — All build/publish/deploy functionality now available through the CLI, deprecating standalone scripts:
  - `publish.py` and `publish.sh` are deprecated — use `idp-cli publish` instead. `publish.py` remains as a thin backward-compatibility wrapper. `publish.sh` has been removed.
  - `scripts/generate_govcloud_template.py` is deprecated — use `idp-cli publish --headless` or `idp-cli deploy --headless` instead. The script remains as a thin wrapper.
  - New `--template-file` option on `idp-cli deploy` for deploying from a local CloudFormation template file produced by a previous `idp-cli publish`.
  - `idp-cli deploy --headless` (without `--from-code`) now downloads the published template, transforms to headless with GovCloud config defaults, uploads to S3, and deploys — all in one command.

### Fixed

- **HITL review start overwrites document sections** — Fixed the Start Review action to update only the Review Status and Review Owner fields, preserving all existing document sections and other fields.

- **Evaluation schema error for free-form objects** — Stickler mapper now detects and skips unevaluable object schemas (e.g., objects with `additionalProperties` but no defined `properties`, and arrays of such objects) instead of raising validation errors.

- **Full document reprocess not re-running OCR** — Fixed bug where clicking "Reprocess" in the UI reused stale OCR results from the previous run instead of re-executing OCR with the current configuration. The reprocess resolver now deletes previous output data from S3 before queuing, preventing the OCR function's retry-safe recovery from reinstalling old results.

- **Agentic extraction timeout on long documents** — Fixed repeated Lambda timeouts when agentic extraction exceeds the 15-minute limit on large documents (e.g., 25-page brokerage statements with 600+ holdings). Added incremental S3 checkpointing that saves extraction state after each tool call — covers both the extraction tools path (`extraction_tool`, `apply_json_patches`, `make_buffer_data_final_extraction`) and the buffer tools path (`patch_buffer_data`) that the agent uses for very large batched extractions. The checkpoint format tracks which state was saved (`current_extraction` vs `intermediate_extraction` buffer) so the correct resume path is used. On Step Function retry, the Lambda loads the checkpoint and the agent resumes from where it left off rather than restarting from scratch. No CloudFormation or Step Function changes required — the existing `Sandbox.Timedout` retry mechanism now makes incremental progress. Only active when agentic extraction is enabled; standard extraction is unaffected.

- **Agentic extraction fails on Bedrock InternalServerException without retrying** — Fixed `InternalServerException` errors (transient Bedrock server-side errors) causing immediate Lambda failure after only botocore's fast 7 retries, bypassing the application-level retry decorator (50 retries with 5s→1800s exponential backoff). Root cause: `InternalServerException` and `InternalServerError` were missing from all three retry layers — the `async_exponential_backoff_retry` decorator's `DEFAULT_RETRYABLE_ERRORS` set (`bedrock_utils.py`), the `BedrockClient._invoke_with_retry()` retryable errors list (`bedrock/client.py`), and the Step Functions ExtractionStep Retry `ErrorEquals` list (`workflow.asl.json`). All three layers now include these transient errors, providing proper exponential backoff retry at the application level and Lambda-level retry via Step Functions as a safety net.

## [0.5.3]

### Added

- **Discovery UX Enhancements** — Major improvements to the Discovery experience:
  - **Multi-Section Package Discovery** — New "Multi-Section Package" discovery mode with PDF page thumbnail preview, color-coded page ranges, and parallel job creation. Users define page ranges to discover multiple classes from a single PDF. Each range creates an independent discovery job.
  - **✨ AI Auto-Detect Sections** — "Auto-detect sections" button uses a configurable LLM prompt (`discovery.auto_split`) to automatically identify document boundaries and pre-fill page ranges with document type labels.
  - **Discovery Mode Selector** — Tile-based mode choice between "Single Section Document" (with optional ground truth) and "Multi-Section Package" (with page ranges). Ground truth and page ranges are mutually exclusive.
  - **Class Name Hints** — Document type labels (from auto-detect or manual entry) are passed as class name hints to guide the discovery LLM's `$id` and `x-aws-idp-document-type` output.
  - **Real-time Job Monitoring** — Live progress messages, elapsed time counters, phased upload status ("Creating jobs..." → "Uploading..." → "Refreshing..."), discovered class name badges, and expandable error details with user-friendly messages.
  - **Jobs Table UX** — Search/filter, time range selector, pagination, resizable columns, column preferences, multi-select delete, config version hyperlinks, and page range badges on multi-section jobs.
  - **S3 Upload Race Condition Fix** — Replaced hardcoded `time.sleep(30)` with smart S3 polling using exponential backoff (2s–10s, 60s timeout).
  - **New GraphQL APIs** — `autoDetectSections` mutation, `pageRanges`/`pageLabels` on `uploadDiscoveryDocument`, `pageRange`/`discoveredClassName`/`statusMessage` on job types, `deleteDiscoveryJob` mutation.

- **Discovery CLI & SDK Enhancements** — New capabilities in `idp-cli discover` and `client.discovery` that bring parity with the Web UI's Discovery features:
  - **Class Name Hints** — `--class-hint` (CLI) / `class_name_hint=` (SDK) to pre-label discovered classes, guiding the LLM's `$id` output.
  - **Multi-Section Page Ranges** — `--page-range "1-3" --page-label "W2 Form"` (CLI, repeatable) / `discovery.run_multi_section(page_ranges=[...])` (SDK) to discover multiple document classes from a single multi-page PDF.
  - **AI Auto-Detect Sections** — `--auto-detect` / `--detect-only` (CLI) / `discovery.auto_detect_sections()` (SDK) to automatically identify document section boundaries using LLM analysis, then optionally discover each section.
  - **BDA Sync Command** — New `idp-cli config-sync-bda` command and `client.config.sync_bda()` SDK method for explicit bidirectional synchronization between IDP configuration classes and BDA blueprints. Supports `--direction` (bidirectional, bda-to-idp, idp-to-bda) and `--mode` (replace, merge).
  - **New Models** — `AutoDetectResult`, `AutoDetectSection`, `ConfigSyncBdaResult`, `page_range` field on `DiscoveryResult`.

- **IDP SDK & CLI Overhaul** — Major refactoring of the SDK and CLI for a cleaner, more maintainable architecture:
  - **`IDPClient` entry point** — Single public interface with typed namespace access (`client.batch`, `client.stack`, `client.config`, `client.manifest`, `client.testing`). CLI commands now route through `IDPClient` instead of importing internal modules, ensuring consistent behavior across CLI, Web UI, and programmatic access.
  - **Typed return models** — SDK operations return Pydantic models instead of raw dictionaries, enabling IDE auto-complete and type checking.
  - **Enhanced config validation** — Manifest and config validation reports deprecated/unknown fields; config upload detects whether a version exists and handles creation vs. update correctly.
  - **Enhanced stack operations** — Deploy and delete commands support in-progress detection, live monitoring, cancel-update, and failure analysis.
  - **Private API boundaries** — Internal modules renamed from `core/` to `_core/` with lint rules enforcing the boundary.

- **IDP MCP Connector** — Local package that bridges coding assistants like Cline and Kiro to the IDP MCP Server with automatic Cognito authentication and dynamic tool discovery.

- **ALB+S3 VPC Hosting Mode** — Alternative web UI hosting using Application Load Balancer with S3 VPC Interface Endpoint for environments that require VPC-based hosting (private networks, regulated environments, corporate networks without internet-facing CDN access). ([#245](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/245))
  - New `WebUIHosting` parameter (`CloudFront` | `ALB`) with conditional resource creation — CloudFront and ALB resources are mutually exclusive
  - ALB hosting nested stack (`nested/alb-hosting/template.yaml`) with ALB, S3 Interface VPC Endpoint, security groups, custom resource Lambdas for VPC CIDR lookup and target registration
  - TLS 1.3 enforcement, access logging, scoped VPC endpoint policy (`s3:GetObject`/`s3:ListBucket` only), and multi-CIDR security group ingress management
  - Self-signed certificate generation script (`scripts/generate_self_signed_cert.sh`) for demo/testing
  - New documentation: `docs/alb-hosting.md` — prerequisites, deployment steps, security considerations, troubleshooting, CloudFront vs ALB comparison

- **`make help` target** — Added `make help` with categorized, auto-generated descriptions for all 33 Makefile targets; updated CONTRIBUTING.md to match.

- **Test Studio Field-Level Metrics** — Test results now display per-field extraction performance in an interactive table showing Field Name, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, TP, FP, TN, FN. Metrics are searchable, sortable, and paginated in an expandable section. Enables identification of low-performing fields and tracking improvements after configuration changes.

- **Stickler Bulk Aggregation for Test Studio** — Test Studio now uses Stickler's `BulkStructuredModelEvaluator` with `aggregate_from_comparisons()` for accurate metric aggregation across multiple documents. Each document is evaluated with `include_confusion_matrix=True`, results are stored in S3, and aggregated when viewing test results. Eliminates Athena queries for new data, improving accuracy, consistency, and cost-effectiveness.

- **RBAC Security Hardening** — Comprehensive audit and hardening of GraphQL API authorization against the documented RBAC permission matrix:
  - **Query-level `@aws_auth` directives** — Added server-side role enforcement to 20+ GraphQL queries that were previously open to all authenticated users. Configuration, pricing, capacity, discovery, test studio, config library, and agent query system queries now enforce role restrictions at the AppSync schema level (e.g., Reviewer cannot access configuration, discovery, test studio, or pricing queries).
  - **Admin-only enforcement for "Save as Version" / "Save as Default"** — The `updateConfiguration` resolver now checks caller role and rejects non-Admin users attempting `saveAsVersion` or `saveAsDefault` operations, which were previously only blocked in the UI.
  - **Server-side RBAC filtering in `listDocumentsByDateRange`** — Added reviewer-only document filtering and config-version scope filtering to the date range resolver, matching the existing `listDocuments` GSI resolver pattern. Updated CloudFormation template with `USERS_TABLE_NAME` environment variable and DynamoDB IAM permissions.
  - **Updated RBAC documentation** (`docs/rbac.md`) — Complete mutation and query authorization tables, AppSync `@aws_auth` + `@aws_iam` limitation documented, all previously missing API entries added.

- **Threat Model Documentation** — Comprehensive threat model for the GenAI IDP Accelerator covering architecture overview, STRIDE analysis, feature-specific threats (agent analysis, companion chat, knowledge base, Lambda hooks, MCP integration, RBAC, reporting, SDK/CLI, web UI), risk assessment matrix, AI-generated threat analysis, implementation guide, and Threat Composer JSON export.

- **Managed Configuration Versions** — Pre-deployed test sets now have dedicated stack-managed config versions (`managed: true`) that are automatically created and overwritten on stack updates. Save and delete are disabled for managed versions in the UI and API. Test Studio auto-selects the matching config version when a test set is selected, replacing the hardcoded mapping.

- **Removed older Claude models** from Configuration UI picklists (3.x, 4.0, 4.1). Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.5, and Opus 4.6 are available for selection in the UI. Existing configurations using older versions still work.

### Changed

- **SDK & CLI: Renamed processing commands for clarity** — Old names are deprecated (emit `DeprecationWarning`) but remain available for backward compatibility:
  - `client.batch.run()` → `client.batch.process()`
  - `client.batch.rerun()` → `client.batch.reprocess()` (same for `client.document.rerun()` → `.reprocess()`)
  - `idp-cli run-inference` → `idp-cli process`
  - `idp-cli rerun-inference` → `idp-cli reprocess`
- **SDK: `stack.delete()` now waits by default** — The `wait` parameter defaults to `True` (previously fire-and-forget). Pass `wait=False` to restore the old behavior.
- **MCP: Renamed `docs/mcp-integration.md` to `docs/mcp-server.md`** for clarity.
- **MCP: Renamed Lambda function `agentcore_analytics_processor` to `agentcore_mcp_handler`** to better reflect its role as the MCP protocol handler (not just analytics).
  - CloudFormation resource `AgentCoreAnalyticsLambdaFunction` → `AgentCoreMCPHandlerFunction`
  - CloudFormation resource `AgentCoreAnalyticsLambdaLogGroup` → `AgentCoreMCPHandlerLogGroup`
  - Lambda FunctionName: `${StackName}-agentcore-analytics` → `${StackName}-agentcore-mcp-handler`
  - Source directory: `src/lambda/agentcore_analytics_processor/` → `src/lambda/agentcore_mcp_handler/`

- **Page images broken for document IDs containing parentheses** — Fixed issue where document page thumbnails and Visual Document Editor images failed to load (showing "Image load error") when the document ID contained parentheses (e.g., `lending_package(1).pdf`). Root cause: JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent()` does not encode `(`, `)`, `!`, `'`, `*` but AWS S3 SigV4 requires them to be percent-encoded in the canonical URI, causing signature mismatches. Added S3-safe URI encoding in `generate-s3-presigned-url.ts`.
- **"View Rule Validation Summary" button not appearing in real-time** — Fixed two-part bug: (1) State machine `ResultPath` for rule validation steps wrote to `$.RuleValidationOrchestrationResult` instead of `$.Result`, so downstream steps lost the `rule_validation_result`. (2) `RuleValidationResultUri` was missing from `UPDATE_DOCUMENT` and `GET_DOCUMENT` GraphQL selection sets in `mutations.py`, so AppSync subscriptions never delivered the field to the UI. Button appeared only after page refresh.
- **Page images broken for document IDs containing parentheses** — Fixed issue where document page thumbnails and Visual Document Editor images failed to load (showing "Image load error") when the document ID contained parentheses (e.g., `lending_package(1).pdf`). Root cause: JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent()` does not encode `(`, `)`, `!`, `'`, `*` but AWS S3 SigV4 requires them to be percent-encoded in the canonical URI, causing signature mismatches. Added S3-safe URI encoding in `generate-s3-presigned-url.ts`.
- **"View Rule Validation Summary" button not appearing in real-time** — Fixed two-part bug: (1) State machine `ResultPath` for rule validation steps wrote to `$.RuleValidationOrchestrationResult` instead of `$.Result`, so downstream steps lost the `rule_validation_result`. (2) `RuleValidationResultUri` was missing from `UPDATE_DOCUMENT` and `GET_DOCUMENT` GraphQL selection sets in `mutations.py`, so AppSync subscriptions never delivered the field to the UI. Button appeared only after page refresh.
- **Fillable PDF form fields missing from rendered page images** — Fixed bug where fillable PDF form fields (text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns) were not rendered in page images, causing OCR and extraction to miss user-entered data. Two-part fix: (1) `PdfDocument.init_forms()` initializes the form rendering engine so PDFium can process form fields, and (2) `page.flatten()` merges form field appearances into page content before rendering — required because many fillable PDFs (especially government forms) lack pre-generated appearance streams. Applied in both Pattern 2 (`OcrService`) and Pattern 1 (`create_pdf_page_images`) PDF rendering pipelines. ([#240](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/240))
- **CLI monitoring exits prematurely before documents start processing** — Fixed bug where `idp-cli process --monitor` would exit immediately after uploading documents, showing 0% completion even though documents were still queued. Root cause: The monitoring loop checked `all_complete` which returned `True` when no documents had completed or failed yet (0 == 0). Added 60-second grace period before allowing early exit, ensuring monitoring waits for documents to be picked up by the queue and start processing.
- **Discovery subscription handler dropping errorMessage and other fields** — Fixed bug where the UI subscription handler did `{ ...oldJob, status: updatedJob.status }`, discarding all fields except status from real-time subscription updates. Error messages, discovered class names, and status messages were being sent by the backend but silently dropped by the UI. Now spreads all fields: `{ ...oldJob, ...updatedJob }`.
- **Discovery processor S3 race condition causing NoSuchKey failures** — The discovery upload resolver sends the SQS message before the browser finishes uploading the file to S3 via presigned POST. Previously worked around with a hardcoded `time.sleep(30)`. Replaced with `_wait_for_s3_object()` that polls S3 with exponential backoff (2s initial, 10s max, 60s timeout), proceeding as soon as the file appears.
- **CLI `--parameters` parsing for comma-delimited values** — Fixed `idp-cli deploy --parameters` to handle values containing commas (e.g., `ALBSubnetIds=subnet-a,subnet-b`). Previously the naive `split(",")` broke multi-value parameters. ([#245](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/245))
- **GovCloud template: fix unresolved RBAC resource dependencies** — Added `AuthorGroup`, `ViewerGroup`, `GetMyProfileResolver`, and `UpdateUserResolver` to GovCloud removal lists so they are stripped alongside the `UserPool` they depend on.
- **Document status and sections not updating in real-time during processing** — Fixed regression from RBAC commit where `updateDocumentStatus` subscription events (used during Map state steps: Extraction, Assessment, Rule Validation) were silently discarded because they lacked `InitialEventTime`/`QueuedTime` fields, causing `isDocumentInActiveRange` to reject them. Also fixed: stale sections/pages not clearing immediately on full reprocess, sections appearing duplicated or out of order during parallel Map execution (null-protection merge + client-side sort by page ID).
- **Fix race condition in `idp-cli generate-manifest --test-set`** — Added `.uploading` marker file protocol to prevent the test set resolver from prematurely validating test sets while the CLI is still uploading baseline files ([#193](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/193)).
- **Test Fixes** — Updated CLI test mocks to align with the new `IDPClient`-based implementation, fixing broken test fixtures that referenced removed internal imports.

## [0.5.2]

### Added

- **Multi-tenancy with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — 4-role model (Admin, Author, Reviewer, Viewer) with server-side AppSync auth directives, server-side Reviewer document filtering, and UI adaptation. Admin has full access; Author can edit config and process documents but cannot manage users or delete config versions; Viewer has read-only access (editors, save buttons, and edit mode all disabled); Reviewer sees only HITL-pending documents. Non-admin roles can be scoped to specific use cases via `allowedConfigVersions`. See `docs/rbac.md`.

- **Standard Class Catalog** — When adding a new document class in the Schema Builder, users can now choose between **Custom Class** (define from scratch) and **Standard Class** (import from a catalog of 35 pre-built document types). Standard classes are derived from AWS BDA standard blueprints and include common document types like Invoice, Receipt, W-2, Bank Statement, Payslip, US Driver License, US Passport, various tax forms (1040, 941, 940, W-9, 1098, 1099), insurance cards, birth/death/marriage certificates, and more. Each standard class comes with a complete extraction schema including attributes, descriptions, and nested types. Imported classes are fully editable. Run `make classes-from-bda` to refresh the catalog from the BDA API.

- **Documentation Site** — Added a hosted documentation site built with [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), auto-deployed to GitHub Pages. Provides full-text search (Pagefind), sidebar navigation organized by topic, dark/light mode, and a professional landing page — all sourced directly from the existing `docs/` markdown files with zero content duplication. Browse at [aws-solutions-library-samples.github.io/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws](https://aws-solutions-library-samples.github.io/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/).

- **Discovery accessible from CLI and SDK** — Discovery can now be run programmatically via the IDP SDK (`client.discovery.run()`) and CLI (`idp-cli discover`), enabling users with many document classes to automate schema generation without the Web UI. Supports both modes: without ground truth (exploratory) and with ground truth (optimized). ([#228](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/228))

- **Custom Model Fine-tuning** — Improve extraction and classification accuracy for your specific document types by fine-tuning Amazon Nova models on your own labeled data — no ML expertise required. Select a Test Set with ground truth, choose a base model, and the system handles training data generation, Bedrock fine-tuning, and on-demand model deployment automatically. Custom models are billed pay-per-token with no idle costs. Available to Admin and Author roles. See [Custom Model Fine-tuning](./docs/custom-model-finetuning.md) for details.
  - **Web UI**: New "Custom Models" page with job creation form (test set selector, base model selector, train/validation split), jobs table with status tracking, and detailed job view with deployment status and configuration version creation
  - **CLI / SDK**: `idp-cli finetuning create`, `idp-cli finetuning status`, `idp-cli finetuning list`, `idp-cli finetuning delete` commands for programmatic job management
  - **GraphQL API**: New `createFinetuningJob`, `getFinetuningJob`, `listFinetuningJobs`, `deleteFinetuningJob` mutations/queries with `FinetuningJob` type and real-time status fields
  - **Step Functions Workflow**: 7-Lambda orchestration pipeline — list documents, parallel document processing (Distributed Map), merge training data, create Bedrock fine-tuning job, poll job status, deploy custom model via Provisioned Throughput
  - **CloudFormation Resources**: `FinetuningDataBucket` (S3), `FinetuningStateMachine` (Step Functions), 7 Lambda functions with IAM roles, CloudWatch log groups, and Bedrock permissions for model customization and deployment
  - **Shared Training Data Utilities**: Common module (`idp_common.model_finetuning.training_data_utils`) for extraction field parsing, baseline formatting, PDF-to-image conversion, and document image handling — shared across Lambda functions to eliminate code duplication

### Changed

- **Python 3.12+ now required** — Updated minimum Python version from 3.10 to 3.12 to address security vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies.

- **Sync to BDA no longer auto-activates the config version** — Previously, performing "Sync to BDA" would automatically set the current config version as active. Since each config version now has its own BDA project, auto-activation is unnecessary. Users can manually choose which version to activate via the Versions table. The "Sync to BDA" confirmation modal text has been updated accordingly.

- **Removed `Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) Project ARN` CloudFormation parameter** — The deploy-time `Pattern1BDAProjectArn` parameter has been removed as it was redundant with the per-config-version BDA project management already available in the Web UI, CLI, and GraphQL API. BDA projects are now managed entirely post-deployment: enable `use_bda: true` in your configuration, then use "Sync to BDA" to create or link a BDA project, or "Sync from BDA" to import from any existing BDA project. This simplifies the deployment experience (one fewer parameter) and better aligns the CloudFormation interface with the system's actual architecture. Existing deployed stacks are unaffected — runtime BDA project ARN resolution reads from DynamoDB per-version tracking, not from the CloudFormation parameter. Also removed the unused `nested/bda-lending-project/` directory (dead code not referenced by any template) and the legacy `BDA_PROJECT_ARN` environment variable fallback from the sync resolver.

### Fixed

- **CLI: Remove deprecated `--pattern` references** — Updated `idp-cli.md` and CLI code to reflect the unified pattern architecture. Removed `--pattern` from all deploy and config command examples/options.

- **Discovery no longer injects default config classes into target version** — Previously, running Discovery on a configuration version would merge all classes from the `default` version into the target version alongside the newly discovered class. Now Discovery only adds/updates the discovered class within the target version's own class list, keeping the version's classes exactly as the user curated them.

- **Documentation: Comprehensive review and cleanup** — Fixed outdated references, broken links, and missing content across documentation files.

- **Inference Profile pricing ARN truncation in UI** — Fixed pricing display and cost breakdown truncation for Bedrock Application Inference Profile ARNs containing multiple `/` characters (e.g., `bedrock/arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:123456789012:application-inference-profile/088k6ehrxpci`). The UI was splitting on all `/` separators instead of preserving the full ARN, causing the profile ID to be dropped in the Pricing page display, Test Studio cost breakdowns, and CSV exports. Backend pricing lookup was not affected. ([#237](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/237))

## [0.5.1]

### Added

- **Scalable Document List and Test Executions** — Comprehensive redesign to eliminate UI and backend bottlenecks when working with thousands of documents. ([#203](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/203))
  - **TypeDateIndex GSI on TrackingTable**: New DynamoDB Global Secondary Index (`ItemType` + `InitialEventTime`) enables efficient queries by item type (document, testrun, testset) sorted by time, replacing full table scans. Includes 20 projected attributes for list-view rendering without base table fetches.
  - **GSI Attribute Backfill Mechanism**: Robust Step Functions state machine with parallel scan workers that automatically backfills `ItemType` and `HITLPendingReview` attributes on existing items during stack upgrades. Features timeout-safe continuation, idempotent conditional updates, and automatic trigger via CloudFormation Custom Resource.
  - **GSI-Based Document List Resolver**: New `listDocuments` Lambda resolver queries the TypeDateIndex GSI with server-side pagination (`limit`/`nextToken`).
  - **`getDocumentCount` API**: New efficient count query using GSI `Select: 'COUNT'` for accurate document totals without fetching data.
  - **UI Document List Rewrite**: Eliminated the N+1 query pattern (shard queries → individual `getDocument` per document). Now uses a single paginated `listDocuments` GSI query for all time periods. First page renders immediately with incremental background loading of remaining pages.
  - **Subscription Optimization**: `onUpdateDocument` events now use subscription data directly instead of triggering individual `getDocument` API calls, eliminating thousands of redundant requests during active processing.
  - **GSI-Based Test Runs Query**: Replaced full table scan in `get_test_runs()` and `get_test_runs_by_date_range()` with GSI query + BatchGetItem pattern for efficient test run listing with all fields (including Context, ConfigVersion).
  - **GSI-Based Test Sets Query**: Replaced full table scan in `get_test_sets()` with GSI query + BatchGetItem pattern, avoiding scanning the entire TrackingTable (which includes all documents) just to find ~10 test sets.
  - **`ItemType` Written on All Creation Paths**: All document, test run, and test set creation paths (DynamoDB service, AppSync resolvers, test runners, dataset deployers) now write `ItemType` and `InitialEventTime` for immediate GSI indexing.
  - **Improved Error Messages**: Document list errors now show the actual failure reason (e.g., Lambda throttling, timeout details) instead of generic "please try again" messages.

- **GraphQL Type Generation & Unit Testing** — Replaced 60+ hand-written GraphQL query/mutation/subscription files with auto-generated types via `@graphql-codegen`, added typed AWSJSON parsers with unit tests (vitest + jsdom), and integrated a CI codegen-check to prevent type drift.

- **Third-Party Model Support** — Added Meta Llama 4 Maverick 17B, Llama 4 Scout 17B, Google Gemma 3 27B IT, and NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 12B v2 VL as selectable models across all pipeline stages (OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization, Evaluation, Discovery, Agents, Rule Validation). Includes per-token pricing configuration and EU region fallback mappings for Llama 4 models. ([#217](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/217))

- **Load Test Config Version Support** — Added `--config-version` parameter to the `idp-cli load-test` command, enabling load tests to target a specific configuration version. Files uploaded during load tests now include `config-version` S3 metadata, consistent with the `process` command behavior.

- **Deploy Failure Root Cause Analysis** — Enhanced `idp-cli deploy` failure reporting to recursively analyze nested stack events and identify actual root causes. Previously, failures in nested stacks showed only a generic "Embedded stack was not successfully created" message. Now displays a structured "Root Cause Analysis" section with the specific resource, type, and error message from the nested stack that caused the failure, along with cascade failure counts.

- **MCP Server** — Added additional tool to MCP Server for retrieving results of the processed document from the IDP system.


### Changed


- **OCR Benchmark Config Optimization** — Optimized `config_library/unified/ocr-benchmark` configuration with targeted field descriptions, explicit model/prompt/OCR settings, and corrected date format (YYYY-MM-DD to match ground truth). Improved overall extraction accuracy from 51.5% to 75.2% on the full 293-document benchmark at equivalent cost (~$2.62). Classification remains 100% across all 9 document classes. ([#220](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/220))

- **GraphQL Type Generation & Unit Testing** — Replaced 60+ hand-written GraphQL query/mutation/subscription files with auto-generated types via `@graphql-codegen`, added typed AWSJSON parsers with unit tests (vitest + jsdom), and integrated a CI codegen-check to prevent type drift.

### Fixed

- **AgentCore Gateway Manager** — Fixed the issue where gateway was not getting deleted once stack is deleted.

- **Configuration Page Error Display** — Fixed `[object Object]` error message when configuration loading fails (e.g., due to Lambda throttling) by properly extracting error messages from Amplify GraphQL error responses.

- **OCR Retry Logic** — Fixed broken retry chain between OCR Lambda and Step Functions that caused document processing failures under Textract throttling. The OCR Lambda was catching `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` and re-raising it as a generic `Exception`, which Step Functions didn't match for retries. Now propagates a `ThrottlingException` that Step Functions can retry on. Also added retry-safe page skipping so retries only re-process failed pages instead of re-OCRing the entire document, and increased OCR step retry attempts from 2 to 6 with longer backoff intervals. ([#195](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/195))

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **Unified Pattern** — Merged Pattern-1 (BDA) and Pattern-2 (Pipeline) into a single deployment. Switch between BDA and Pipeline processing modes at runtime using the `use_bda` configuration toggle — no redeployment needed. Use [Test Studio](./docs/test-studio.md) to compare accuracy and cost across both modes to find the optimal approach for your documents. See the [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-v04-to-v05.md) for upgrade instructions.

- **Rule Validation for BDA mode** — Rule validation (business rule checking) is now available in both BDA and Pipeline modes. Previously it was Pipeline-only.

- **Fake W-2 Tax Form Test Set Auto-Deployment** — New pre-deployed benchmark test set with 2,000 synthetically generated US W-2 tax form images and structured ground truth, sourced from HuggingFace (`singhsays/fake-w2-us-tax-form-dataset`, originally from Kaggle under CC0: Public Domain license). Features 45 ground truth fields per document covering employer info (EIN, name, address), employee info (SSN, name, address), federal wages/taxes (boxes 1-8), compensation codes (boxes 12a-d), checkboxes (box 13), and state/local taxes (boxes 15-20). Includes both clean and noisy image variants for testing OCR robustness. Ideal for benchmarking W-2 extraction accuracy, evaluating image quality impact on processing, and testing structured form data extraction at scale.

- **AWS Profile Support for CLI** — Added optional `--profile` parameter to specify AWS credentials profile. Can be placed anywhere in the command. Automatically applies to all AWS SDK calls.

- **Enhanced `status` CLI/MCP Command with Advanced Search, Filtering, and Analytics** — Added PK substring search (`--batch-id` now matches partial batch identifiers across multiple batches), `--object-status` filter for searching by processing status (COMPLETED, FAILED, etc.), `--get-time` flag for timing statistics (processing, queue, total time with min/max outlier tracking), `--include-metering` flag for Lambda GB-seconds usage and cost estimates, and `--show-details` flag for detailed document information. Introduces `TrackingTableSearcher` class for flexible DynamoDB tracking table queries. Fully backward compatible with existing usage.

- **Added Replace/Merge sync modes for BDA synchronization** — Both "Sync from BDA" and "Sync to BDA" now support two modes: **Replace** (default) aligns the target to match the source exactly, removing items not in the source; **Merge** adds source items to the target without removing existing items. The UI modal now always shows a mode selection and ARN input (pre-filled for linked projects).


### Deprecated

- **Pattern-1 (BDA) and Pattern-2 (Pipeline) separate deployments** — Replaced by the Unified Pattern. Existing stacks are automatically upgraded. See the [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-v04-to-v05.md) for details.

- **Pattern-3 (UDOP + Bedrock)** — Pattern-3 is no longer available as a deployment option. If you are currently using Pattern-3 with a SageMaker UDOP endpoint, do not upgrade to v0.5.x without first testing in a non-production environment. You can use the [Lambda Inference Hooks](./docs/lambda-hook-inference.md) feature (introduced in v0.4.15) to call your existing SageMaker UDOP endpoint from the unified pattern's classification step via a custom Lambda function.

### Changed


- **Switched `idp_sdk` pyproject.toml to auto-discovery** — Replaced explicit subpackage listing with `setuptools.packages.find` using `include = ["idp_sdk*"]` so new subpackages are automatically included without manual pyproject.toml updates.

- **Resilient Test Set Deployment — Graceful Degradation on Download Failures** — All test set deployer Lambdas (RealKIE-FCC, OmniAI-OCR-Benchmark, DocSplit-Poly-Seq) now handle download failures gracefully instead of causing CloudFormation stack rollbacks. When a dataset source (HuggingFace) is unreachable or a download fails, the deployer creates a FAILED test set record in DynamoDB with a descriptive error message visible in the Test Studio UI, and sends `cfnresponse.SUCCESS` to CloudFormation so the stack deployment continues. Previously failed deployments are automatically retried on the next stack update. This ensures transient third-party service outages never block IDP infrastructure deployment.

- **Replaced PyMuPDF (AGPL-3.0) with pypdfium2 (Apache-2.0/BSD-3-Clause) for PDF rendering** — Resolves license incompatibility with the project's MIT-0 license. pypdfium2 provides equivalent PDF-to-image rendering using PDFium engine. Page rendering is now performed sequentially before parallel OCR processing to ensure thread-safety.

### Fixed

- **Fixed "Sync from BDA" not removing IDP classes absent from BDA project** — Previously, "Sync from BDA" only added new classes from the BDA project without removing classes that weren't in BDA. Now defaults to "Replace" mode which fully aligns the config version's classes with the BDA project, removing classes not present in BDA. A new "Merge" mode is also available to preserve the legacy additive behavior.

- **Fixed insufficient Lambda memory for Extraction, Assessment, and Evaluation functions in unified pattern template** — Increased MemorySize from 512 MB (Extraction, Assessment) and 1024 MB (Evaluation) to 4096 MB to match all other document processing Lambda functions, preventing potential out-of-memory errors during document processing. ([#205](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/205))

- **Fixed DOCX processing to extract text from embedded images and correct page splitting** — DOCX files with embedded images (e.g., `<w:drawing>` elements) now have image content OCR'd and included in the extracted text instead of being silently skipped. Page splitting now uses DOCX metadata (explicit page breaks, image display dimensions from `wp:extent`, section properties) instead of inaccurate height estimates, producing correct page boundaries.

  - Comprehensive capacity planning tool to optimize document processing performance, predict resource requirements, and calculate AWS service quota needs
  - **Pattern 2 Exclusive**: Only available for Pattern 2 deployments
  - **Token Usage Configuration**: Define expected tokens per document type for each processing step (OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, Summarization)
  - **Auto-Populate from Documents**: Extract token usage and page counts from actual processed documents' metering data with time range filtering (2hrs to 30 days or custom date range)
  - **Processing Schedule**: Configure hourly document volumes with template-based auto-fill options (single slot, all doc types at 9 AM, business hours, full day)
  - **Quota Calculation**: Automated AWS Bedrock quota requirements (TPM and RPM) with 10% safety buffer
  - **Export Capabilities**: Complete capacity plan export with configuration version, model details, token usage, schedule, and quota requirements
  - **GitHub Feedback Integration**: Beta feature with direct link to GitHub Issues for user feedback
  - **Documentation**: New [capacity-planning.md](docs/capacity-planning.md) with comprehensive feature guide, calculation formulas, and safety buffer explanations
- **React UI TypeScript Migration (Phases 1–3 — Complete)** — Completed full migration of the React UI codebase from JSX/JS to TSX/TS. Phases 1–2 added TypeScript tooling and migrated contexts, hooks, constants, and utilities. Phase 3 migrated all remaining 207 components, GraphQL operations, routes, modals, and entry points across 13 incremental sub-phases (211 files changed). Removed `prop-types` dependency; all runtime prop validation replaced with TypeScript interfaces. No behavioral or visual changes. ([#187](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/187), [#188](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/188), [#191](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/191), [#198](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/198))
- **Configuration Version Management Commands for CLI and SDK** — Added `config-list`, `config-activate`, and `config-delete` CLI commands and corresponding `client.config.list()`, `client.config.activate()`, `client.config.delete()` SDK operations for programmatic configuration version management. Includes safety protections (default/active version deletion prevention, confirmation prompts, existence validation), `--force` flag for automation, and Rich table output for version listing.
- **Added support for Claude Opus 4.6 model and Long Context (1M) variant**
- **Added support for Claude Sonnet 4.6 model and Long Context (1M) variant**
- **Included MCP tools `process`, `reprocess`, `status`, `search` for document processing**
- **Added `process` and `reprocess` CLI commands for batch operations via command line**
- **Added external mcp client example `examples/external-mcp-client`**
- **Maintained `run-inference` and `rerun-inference` CLI commands with deprecation notices**

### Fixed

- **Fixed DynamoDB 400KB item size limit blocking configs with 45+ document classes** — Configuration data is now gzip-compressed before storing to DynamoDB, achieving 37-95x compression ratios. Supports 3,000+ document classes within the 400KB limit. Fully backward compatible with existing deployments. ([#200](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/200), [#201](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/201))
- **Fixed Processing Flow chart using active stack config instead of the document's actual config version** for determining disabled steps (assessment, summarization, etc.)
- **Fixed `idp_sdk` pip install from GitHub missing subpackages** — Non-editable pip installs of `idp_sdk` from GitHub were missing `core/`, `models/`, and `operations/` subpackages, causing `ModuleNotFoundError`. Fixed by explicitly declaring all subpackages in `pyproject.toml`. ([#196](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/196))

## [0.4.15]

### Added

- **Lambda Hook Inference (Custom LLM Integration)**
  - Customers can provide their own custom Lambda function to integrate with any LLM — models hosted on SageMaker, ECS, EC2, or external APIs — by selecting `LambdaHook` as the model in any pipeline step
  - **Per-Step Granularity**: Configure LambdaHook independently for OCR, Classification, Extraction, Assessment, and Summarization (Pattern-2)
  - **Converse API-Compatible Contract**: Lambda receives the same Converse API payload structure used with Bedrock, and returns a Converse API-compatible response — documented request/response format for easy implementation
  - **S3 Image References**: Inline image bytes automatically uploaded to S3 and replaced with `s3Location` references to avoid Lambda's 6MB payload limit
  - **GENAIIDP- Naming Convention**: Lambda function names must start with `GENAIIDP-` for secure, scoped IAM permissions
  - **Built-in Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient errors (throttling, timeouts), matching Bedrock retry behavior
  - **Metering Integration**: Token usage from Lambda response tracked in document metering data for cost calculations
  - **Sample Functions**: Examples in `samples/lambda-hook-inference/` — Bedrock proxy (with customization points) and SageMaker endpoint hook, with SAM template
  - **Documentation**: New [lambda-hook-inference.md](docs/lambda-hook-inference.md) with architecture diagram, configuration guide, payload contract, SageMaker example, IAM, and limitations

- **Configuration Versioning System**
  - Manage multiple named configuration versions as complete, self-contained snapshots
  - **Version Management UI**: Configuration Versions table with create, compare, activate, delete, and import operations; version comparison with CSV/JSON export
  - **Full Config Storage**: Each version stores the complete configuration; editing and saving a version persists the full config, making behavior predictable and debuggable
  - **Active Version**: One version is marked active for new document processing; selectable when uploading documents, running tests, or reprocessing
  - **Version Tracking**: Config version recorded per document (S3 metadata + DynamoDB) and displayed across Document List, Document Details, Test Studio results, and all exports
  - **Unsaved Changes Protection**: Per-field unsaved change indicators (orange dots), info banner with "Discard changes" button, and browser navigation guards (`beforeunload` + SPA hash navigation)
  - **CLI Integration**: `--config-version` parameter for `run-inference`, `config-download`, and `config-upload` commands with version validation before processing
  - **Test Studio Integration**: Version selector in Test Runner, version tracking per test run, version displayed in Test Results and Test Comparison views
  - **Legacy Support**: Existing sparse-delta configs auto-detected and seamlessly migrated to full format on first read
  - **Stack Upgrade Independence**: Stack upgrades update only the `default` version; user versions are locked snapshots that users explicitly manage
  - **Documentation**: New [configuration-versions.md](docs/configuration-versions.md) with comprehensive feature documentation
  - **~200 lines of merge/delta/sync code removed**: Eliminated runtime merge logic, auto-sync on default updates, null-as-deletion semantics, and auto-cleanup of matching defaults

- **Custom Date Range Selector for Document List and Test Executions** - [GitHub Issue #177](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/177)
  - Added "Custom range..." option to the time period dropdown in both Document List and Test Studio → Test Results
  - Users can now select absolute start/end dates to query historical documents beyond the previous 30-day limit
  - **Scalable Server-Side Architecture**: Custom date ranges use a new `listDocumentsByDateRange` Lambda resolver that iterates shards server-side and batch-fetches documents, avoiding the client-side fan-out scalability issue
  - **Existing Behavior Preserved**: Relative period presets (2h through 30d) continue using the proven client-side shard mechanism — zero changes to existing code paths
  - **365-Day Maximum**: Date range capped at 365 days in the UI to prevent unbounded queries

### Fixed

- **Schema Builder Few-Shot Examples Input Focus Loss** - [GitHub Issue #174](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/174)
  - Fixed cursor jumping out of input fields after each keystroke when editing few-shot examples in the Schema Builder


- **Code Intelligence Agent - DeepWiki MCP Transport Migration**
  - Fixed "client initialization failed" error when using Code Intelligence Agent in Agent Companion Chat
  - **Root Cause**: DeepWiki deprecated their SSE transport endpoint (`/sse`) and now returns HTTP 410 Gone
  - **Solution**: Migrated from SSE (`sse_client`) to Streamable HTTP (`streamablehttp_client`) transport using the new `/mcp` endpoint
  - See DeepWiki documentation: https://docs.devin.ai/work-with-devin/deepwiki-mcp

## [0.4.14]

### Added

- **Enhanced BDA to IDP Sync for Pattern-1**
  - Separate "Sync from BDA" and "Sync to BDA" buttons in the UI for explicit directional control instead of bidirectional-only sync
  - Parallel blueprint processing for improved sync performance on configurations with many document classes
  - Orphaned blueprint cleanup automatically detects and removes BDA blueprints no longer defined in IDP configuration
  - Warning notifications for skipped properties due to BDA limitations (nested arrays/objects), with guidance to flatten schemas using top-level `$defs`
  - AWS standard blueprint filtering prevents unintended modifications to AWS-managed blueprints

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Review Workflow Improvements**
  - **Review Ownership Model**: Reviewers must now claim documents using "Start Review" before editing, preventing concurrent edits
  - **Review In Progress Status**: New status displayed when a reviewer has claimed a document
  - **Filtered Document List for Reviewers**: Reviewers now see only documents pending review or their own in-progress reviews
  - **Admin Skip All Reviews**: Admins can skip all remaining section reviews without triggering document reprocessing
  - **Release Review**: Reviewers can release claimed documents back to pending status; Admins can release any review
  - **Review Completed By Field**: New column showing who completed or skipped the review (renamed from "Reviewed By")

- **Pattern-1 Edit Mode with Data-Only Editing and Reprocessing**
  - Added Edit Mode capability for Pattern-1 (BDA) stacks, enabling users to edit extraction data without modifying section structure
  - **Data-Only Editing**: Click "Edit Mode" then use "Edit Data" buttons on each section to open the Visual Editor for modifying predictions and ground truth
  - **Reprocessing Without BDA**: "Save and Reprocess" triggers evaluation and summarization steps without re-invoking Bedrock Data Automation (BDA)
  - **Section Structure Protection**: Section structure (IDs, classes, page assignments) remains read-only as managed by BDA blueprints
  - **Skip Logic Implementation**: State machine automatically detects existing pages/sections data and bypasses BDA invocation for reprocessing scenarios
  - **Use Cases**: Correct extraction errors, add baseline data for evaluation comparison, re-run evaluation after data corrections, update document summaries

### Changed


- **HITL Decoupled from Step Functions**: HITL review operations now update document status directly in DynamoDB without triggering workflow reprocessing, improving reliability and reducing unintended side effects

- **Renamed TestSet from RVL-CDIP-N-MP to DocSplit-Poly-Seq**
  - Updated Test Studio test set name to better reflect its purpose as a document splitting and classification benchmark
  - The underlying HuggingFace dataset source (`jordyvl/rvl_cdip_n_mp`) remains unchanged

- **Review Status Labels**: Renamed status values for consistency:
  - "Pending Review" → "Review Pending"
  - "Reviewed By" column → "Review Completed By"

### Fixed

- **HITL Decimal Serialization Error**: Fixed "Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable" error when performing HITL operations (Start Review, Release Review, Skip All Reviews) by properly converting DynamoDB Decimal types

- **HITL Operations Clearing Estimated Cost**: Fixed issue where Start Review and Release Review operations were inadvertently clearing the Metering/Estimated Cost data by re-serializing the entire document; operations now update only HITL-specific fields

- **Pattern-1 Page/Section Number Alignment with Pattern-2 and Ground Truth**
  - Fixed page and section numbering mismatch between Pattern-1 (BDA) and Pattern-2 that caused evaluation failures when using shared test sets
  - **Root Cause**: BDA outputs 0-based indices while Pattern-2 and ground truth test sets use 1-based page IDs
  - **Solution**: Pattern-1 postprocessing now transforms S3 paths and Document model IDs to 1-based (`pages/1/`, `sections/1/`, `page_ids: ["1", "2"]`) while preserving 0-based `page_indices` arrays in result.json for internal consistency
  - **Key Distinction**: `page_indices` (array indices) remain 0-based, `page_id`/`section_id` (identifiers) are now 1-based
  - Both patterns now align correctly for evaluation with shared test sets and ground truth data

- **TIFF Image Format Support for Bedrock-Compatible Processing**
  - Fixed classification failure when processing TIFF image files ("Unsupported image format: TIFF")
  - OCR step now converts non-Bedrock-compatible formats (TIFF, BMP) to JPEG during page image extraction
  - Multi-page TIFF files handled like PDFs - each page becomes a separate document page

- **Discovery Feature Overwriting Existing Classes During Class Discovery**
  - Fixed issue where using Discovery to discover a new document type would delete all existing classes from the configuration
  - **Root Cause**: Custom config `classes` array was replacing Default `classes` array during runtime merge, causing loss of existing classes
  - **Solution**: Discovery now reads both Default and Custom classes, merges them with the newly discovered class, and saves the complete merged list to Custom config
  - Ensures discovered classes are additive to existing configuration rather than replacing it

## [0.4.13]

### Added

- **Rule Validation for Automated Compliance Assessment**
  - Added Rule Validation module enabling automated validation of extracted document data against configurable business rules and compliance criteria
  - **Key Capabilities**: Validate documents against any domain-specific compliance requirements (healthcare, financial, legal, insurance, manufacturing), customizable pass/fail criteria adaptable to industry needs, concurrent processing with intelligent chunking for large documents
  - **Dual Output Formats**: JSON for programmatic integration and Markdown for human review
  - **Integration**: Integrated into Pattern-2 workflow with AWS Step Functions parallel processing
  - **Example Use Cases**: Healthcare prior authorization validation, loan application compliance checking, contract clause verification, claims validation, quality control
  - **Configuration**: Fully configurable via `rule_validation` settings including custom recommendation options, model selection, and processing limits
  - **Documentation**: Complete guide in `docs/rule-validation.md` 

- **Visual Document Editor Enhancements**
  - **Improved Navigation Controls**: Mouse wheel zoom (no modifier key required) and click-and-drag panning for intuitive document image exploration
  - **Inline Field Editing with S3 Save**: Edit prediction values directly in the visual editor with change tracking, edit history, and direct S3 persistence
  - **Evaluation Baseline Editing**: Edit baseline (expected) values directly in the editor when evaluation data is available, with dedicated save/discard controls and independent change tracking from predictions
  - **Save & Reprocess Workflow**: After saving edits to predictions or baselines, trigger reprocessing to re-run summarization and evaluation with updated data; document automatically transitions through SUMMARIZING → EVALUATING → COMPLETE statuses
  - **Tabbed Interface**: New tabs for Visual Editor (form-based), JSON Editor (raw JSON with section filtering), and Revision History (audit trail with timestamps and field-level diffs)
  - **Smart Filtering**: Filter to show only low-confidence fields or evaluation mismatches; collapsible tree navigation with Expand/Collapse All controls
  - **Evaluation Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side predicted vs expected values with match indicators (✓/⚠), evaluation scores, and LLM-generated comparison reasons
  - **Section Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons to navigate between document sections without closing the editor

- **Section-Level DynamoDB Updates for Parallel Processing Optimization**
  - Added lightweight `updateDocumentStatus` mutation for status-only updates (~500 bytes vs ~100KB full document)
  - Added atomic `updateDocumentSection` mutation for individual section updates using `SET Sections[index] = :value`
  - **Scalability**: Eliminates DynamoDB throttling for very large documents by avoiding full-document read-modify-write cycles
  - **Real-time Updates**: Both new mutations now trigger `onUpdateDocument` subscription for UI synchronization
  - **Pattern-2/3 Integration**: Extraction and assessment functions now use section-level updates instead of full document rewrites


### Fixed

- **Visual Editor Confidence Alerts Filter Not Showing Null Fields** - Fixed issue where the "Confidence Alerts Only" filter in the Document Details visual editor was not displaying fields with `null` values, even when they had low confidence scores in `explainability_info`. The filter now properly detects and shows all low-confidence fields regardless of their value type.

- **Evaluation Failure for Schemas with Empty Nested Objects** - Fixed evaluation failing with "field_definitions must contain at least one field" error when document schemas contain nested objects with empty properties (e.g., `AccidentInformation: {type: object, properties: {}}`). Empty object properties are now automatically filtered during schema processing.

- **Evaluation Report Section Ordering** - Fixed document sections in evaluation markdown reports iterating in alphabetical order (1, 10, 11, 2, 3) instead of numerical order (1, 2, 3, 10, 11) by implementing natural sorting for section IDs

- **Confidence Alerts Mismatch for JSON Schema `$ref` Properties**
  - Fixed issue where confidence alerts in UI showed incorrect counts (all with confidence=0) that didn't match the actual extraction confidence scores in explainability_info JSON
  - **Root Cause**: Properties using JSON Schema `$ref` references were being incorrectly classified as "simple" types instead of "group" (object) types, causing false positive alerts

- **Configuration Import Float Type Error for DynamoDB**
  - Fixed "Float types are not supported. Use Decimal types instead" error when importing configuration files via CLI (`idp-cli config-upload`) or Web UI

## [0.4.12]

### Added

- **IDP SDK - Python SDK for Programmatic Document Processing**
  - New `idp_sdk` Python package (`lib/idp_sdk/`) providing a native Python interface for IDP operations
  - **IDPClient Class**: Wraps `idp-cli` commands with Pythonic methods for seamless integration into Python applications
  - **Key Methods**: `run_inference()`, `rerun_inference()`, `download_results()`, `status()`, `deploy()`, `delete()`, `delete_documents()`, `validate_manifest()`, `generate_manifest()`, `config_create()`, `config_validate()`, `config_download()`, `config_upload()`
  - **Pydantic Response Models**: Type-safe response objects (`BatchResult`, `ManifestResult`, `ValidationResult`, `ConfigCreateResult`, `ConfigValidationResult`) with proper Pydantic v2 compatibility
  - **Lambda Integration Example**: Complete SAM template and handler demonstrating SDK usage in AWS Lambda functions
  - **Documentation**: SDK reference guide (`docs/idp-sdk.md`) with CLI command mapping, usage examples, and Lambda patterns
  - **Easy Installation**: `pip install -e lib/idp_sdk` or `make setup` installs SDK with all dependencies
  - **Use Cases**: CI/CD pipelines, Lambda functions, automated workflows, custom integrations, and programmatic batch processing

- **Relocated idp-cli to lib/idp_cli_pkg/**
  - Moved `idp_cli/` directory to `lib/idp_cli_pkg/` to co-locate with other library packages
  - Updated all documentation and Makefile targets for new location

- **Modular System Defaults Architecture for Simplified Configuration**
  - Introduced pattern-specific system default files (`lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/config/system_defaults/pattern-{1,2,3}.yaml`) that provide default settings for OCR, classification, extraction, assessment, evaluation, summarization, discovery, and agents
  - User configurations now only need to specify `notes`, `classes`, and any intentional overrides - all other settings inherit from system defaults
  - Simplified all config_library configurations to minimal footprint (most now just 10-30 lines instead of hundreds)
  - Updated all README files in config_library and docs/configuration.md with inheritance documentation
  - **Benefits**: Simpler configs, automatic maintenance when defaults evolve, clearer visibility into customizations

- **Increased Extraction max_tokens Default** - Increased default `max_tokens` for extraction from 10,000 to 65,535 (Nova 2 Lite model maximum) to reduce LLM output truncation on long documents

- **IDP CLI Configuration Management Commands** - [GitHub Issue #87](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/87)
  - `idp-cli config-create` - Generate IDP configuration template from system defaults with selectable feature sets
  - `idp-cli config-validate` - Validate configuration file against system defaults and JSON schema
  - `idp-cli config-download` - Download current configuration from a deployed stack
  - `idp-cli config-upload` - Upload a local configuration file to a deployed stack's DynamoDB ConfigurationTable

- **IDP CLI Auto-Monitor for In-Progress Stack Operations**
  - Enhanced `idp-cli deploy` and `idp-cli delete` commands to automatically detect in-progress CloudFormation operations
  - **Smart Detection**: When running deploy/delete on a stack that's already creating, updating, deleting, or rolling back, the CLI automatically switches to monitoring mode instead of failing
  - **Seamless UX**: If you forget to use `--wait` on the first run, simply run the same command again to monitor progress
  - **Interactive Cancel for Delete**: When running `idp-cli delete` on a stack with CREATE or UPDATE in progress, offers option to cancel the current operation and proceed with deletion

- **New Make Targets and Documentation**
  - Added `make setup` target to install `idp-cli` and `idp_common` packages in development mode
  - Added `make ui-start` target to start UI dev server with optional `STACK_NAME` parameter for auto-generating `.env` from stack outputs
  - Documented all make targets in CONTRIBUTING.md including setup, lint, test, ui-start, commit, and DSR security scanning

- **IDP CLI New Commands for Operations and Testing**
  - Added `idp-cli load-test` command for throughput testing with configurable document rates (1-10,000/min) and dynamic schedule support via CSV files
  - Added `idp-cli stop-workflows` command for batch workflow termination with interactive confirmation and dry-run mode
  - Added `idp-cli delete-documents` command for removing documents and all associated data from the IDP system
  - Added `idp-cli remove-deleted-stack-resources` command for discovering and removing orphaned resources (CloudFront distributions, response header policies, CloudWatch log groups, AppSync APIs, IAM policies, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables) left behind after IDP stacks are deleted, with multi-region stack discovery, interactive confirmation with "yes/skip all of type" options, and configurable `--check-stack-regions` option
  - Comprehensive unit tests added for all new CLI modules


### Changed


- **Scripts Directory Reorganization**
  - Consolidated development environment setup scripts into `scripts/setup/` subdirectory
  - Moved CI/CD scripts (`codebuild_deployment.py`, `integration_test_deployment.py`, `validate_buildspec.py`, `typecheck_pr_changes.py`, `validate_service_role_permissions.py`) into `scripts/sdlc/` subdirectory
  - Updated all references in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Makefile`, and documentation

### Fixed

- **Fixed Document Details Page Not Loading After Browser Refresh for Document IDs Containing Forward Slashes**
  - Fixed issue where navigating to a document with a `/` in the Document ID (e.g., `folder/filename.pdf`) and then refreshing the browser would result in a blank page
  - **Root Cause**: When the browser refreshes a URL containing `%2F` (encoded slash), it automatically decodes it to `/`. React Router's `:objectKey` parameter only captures a single path segment, so `folder/filename.pdf` was being split into multiple segments, causing a route mismatch
  - **Solution**: Changed the route from `path=":objectKey"` to `path="*"` (wildcard route) to capture the full remaining path including any embedded slashes, and updated `DocumentDetails` component to extract the document key from `params['*']`

- **Improved UX for Document List and Document Details Action Buttons**
  - Added hover tooltips to all Document List toolbar buttons (Refresh, Download, Release Review, Abort, Reprocess, Delete) for better discoverability
  - Converted Abort, Reprocess, Delete, and Release Review buttons to icon-only display for a cleaner, more compact toolbar
  - Added `unlocked` icon to Release Review button to visually represent releasing a human review lock

- **Fixed Evaluation Failure for Documents with Truncated LLM Extraction Output**
  - Fixed evaluation service crash when extraction output contained unparsed `raw_output` instead of structured fields
  - **Root Cause**: When LLM extraction output is truncated (model hits max_tokens limit), the extraction service stores `{"raw_output": "..."}` which caused Pydantic validation errors during evaluation
  - **Solution**: 
    - Added `repair_truncated_json()` utility function that attempts to repair truncated JSON using multiple strategies (closing brackets, finding last complete element, extracting complete fields)
    - Integrated JSON repair into extraction service - most truncated output is now automatically repaired
    - Added detection of `raw_output` case in evaluation service with clear error messaging: "Extraction parsing failed... LLM output could not be parsed as valid JSON. This typically indicates truncated output (model hit max_tokens limit). Consider increasing max_tokens in extraction config."
    - Added metadata fields (`output_truncated`, `output_repaired`, `repair_method`) to track truncation/repair status
    - Enhanced evaluation service type coercion to provide appropriate defaults for required fields when LLM returns null values (prevents Pydantic validation errors like "Field required")

- **Fixed AgentRequestHandler Missing Lambda Invoke Permission for Error Analyzer Agent**
  - Fixed AccessDeniedException when clicking the Troubleshoot button in the Web UI

- **Fixed sectionSplitting=disabled Incorrectly Classifying Documents Based on Blank Pages - [GitHub Issue #167](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/167)**
  - Fixed bug where documents with blank pages could be incorrectly classified as `"unclassifiable_blank_page"` when using `sectionSplitting: disabled`
  - **Root Cause**: Page classification results arrive in completion order (not page order) from ThreadPoolExecutor, so blank/simple pages that finish processing first would end up at index 0 and incorrectly determine the document classification
  - **Solution**: Implemented majority voting strategy that:
    - Uses config-defined classes to determine voting eligibility (only pages matching valid document types from configuration can vote)
    - Automatically excludes any classification not in the config (blank pages, errors, LLM hallucinations)
    - Uses majority voting - most common valid classification wins
    - Uses first page's classification as tie-breaker for determinism
    - Falls back to first page's classification when all pages are unclassifiable
  - **Benefits**: Config-driven approach automatically adapts to any defined document classes without hardcoding exclusion lists
  - Updated documentation in `docs/classification.md` explaining the voting behavior

- **Test Results Config Export Not Properly Merging or Formatting**
  - Fixed issue where config export was downloading raw JSON with separate Default/Custom entries instead of merged config

### Removed

- **Obsolete Scripts Migrated to IDP CLI**
  - Removed `simulate_load.py` and `simulate_dynamic_load.py` (replaced by `idp-cli load-test`)
  - Removed `stop_workflows.sh` (replaced by `idp-cli stop-workflows`)
  - Removed `cleanup_orphaned_resources.py` (replaced by `idp-cli remove-deleted-stack-resources`)
  - Removed `lookup_file_status.sh` (replaced by `idp-cli status --document-id`)
  - Removed unused utilities: `add_lambda_layers.py`, `test_layer_build.py`, `test_pip_extras.py`, `compare_json_files.py`, `benchmark_utils/`

## [0.4.11]

### Added

- **Built-in Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Review System**
  - Replaced Amazon SageMaker A2I (Augmented AI) with a built-in HITL review system integrated directly into the Web UI
  - **Persona-Based Access Control**: 
    - **Admin**: Full access to all documents, can skip reviews, release review locks, and manage users
    - **Reviewer**: Access limited to documents pending HITL review, can claim and complete section reviews
  - **Review Workflow Features**:
    - Start Review button to claim document ownership and prevent concurrent edits
    - Section-level review with inline JSON editing and visual document viewer
    - Mark Section Review Complete to approve individual sections
    - Skip All Reviews (Admin only) to bypass pending reviews and continue workflow
    - Release Review to unlock document for other reviewers
  - **Real-time Status Updates**: Review Status, Review Status, Review Owner, and Reviewed By fields update in real-time across all user sessions via GraphQL subscriptions
  - See [Human-in-the-Loop Review Documentation](./docs/human-review.md) for detailed workflow information
  - **Note**: These are Phase 1 of HITL process updates. In upcoming phases, we are working to deliver futher improvements to human review capabilities with the ability to update document classification, extraction, and resubmit for incremental processing as part of a holistic approach to huiman reviews.
- **User Management**
  - New User Management page for Admin users to create and manage additional Admin & Reviewer accounts
  - Cognito user groups (Admin, Reviewer) for role-based access control
  - Automatic user synchronization with Cognito

- **DocSplit-Poly-Seq Test Set Auto-Deployment**
  - Automatically deploys 500 multi-page packet PDFs from HuggingFace dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/jordyvl/rvl_cdip_n_mp) during stack deployment
  - **13 Document Types**: invoice, email, form, letter, memo, resume, budget, news article, scientific publication, specification, questionnaire, handwritten, and language (non-English) documents
  - **Multi-Document Packets**: Each of 500 packets contains 2-10 distinct subdocuments of different types for comprehensive splitting and classification testing
  - **Packet Statistics**: 7,330 total pages across 2,027 document sections with average of 14.7 pages and 4.1 sections per packet
  - **Ground Truth Included**: Page-level classification and document boundary information for each packet. Extraction ground truth is not included.
  - **Evaluation Capabilities**: Enables testing of page-level classification accuracy, document splitting accuracy, and split order preservation. Does NOT enable testing of extraction accuracy since there is no extraction ground truth for this data set
  - Test set available in Test Studio UI alongside RealKIE-FCC-Verified and OmniAI-OCR-Benchmark datasets
  - Corresponding configs available in Configuration Library
  - Ideal for evaluating document splitting and classification accuracy in complex multi-document scenarios


### Changed


- **HITL Configuration**
  - HITL is now disabled by default in the configuration
  - Users must explicitly enable HITL in the Configuration page (Assessment & HITL Configuration section) to trigger human review workflows
  - `hitl_enabled` setting controls whether documents with low confidence trigger HITL review

### Removed

- **Amazon SageMaker A2I Resources**
  - Removed SageMaker A2I Flow Definition, Human Task UI, and Workteam resources
  - Removed A2I-related Lambda functions (`create_a2i_resources`, `get-workforce-url`)
  - Removed `EnableHITL` and `PrivateWorkteamArn` CloudFormation parameters


### Changed


- **Lambda Layers Architecture for Improved Build Efficiency**
  - Replaced bundled `idp_common` package dependencies in individual Lambda functions with three shared Lambda Layers
  - **Three Specialized Layers**:
    - `base` layer: Core functionality with docs_service and image extras
    - `reporting` layer: Reporting and analytics dependencies
    - `agents` layer: Agent-related dependencies
  - **Key Benefits**:
    - Reduced SAM build times by eliminating redundant dependency installation across 50+ Lambda functions
    - Layer content-based hashing ensures layers are only rebuilt when actual contents change
    - Automatic removal of Lambda runtime packages (boto3, botocore, etc.) reduces layer sizes by ~100MB
    - Layer zips cached locally and in S3, skipping uploads when content hasn't changed
  - **Build System Integration**: publish.py automatically builds, hashes, and uploads layers before SAM builds

- **Enhanced publish.py Performance and Logging**
  - **Consistent Logging Helpers**: Added 8 standardized logging methods (`log_phase`, `log_task`, `log_detail`, `log_success`, `log_cached`, `log_warning`, `log_error`) for uniform output formatting with colored icons and thread prefixes
  - **Timed S3 Uploads**: Added `upload_to_s3_with_timer()` helper with spinner animation, elapsed time display, and optimized `TransferConfig` for multi-threaded multipart uploads
  - **AWS CLI Config Library Sync**: Replaced boto3 ThreadPoolExecutor-based config library upload (~60 lines) with `aws s3 sync` command for built-in concurrency, delta sync (skip unchanged files), and simpler code
  - **Timing Breakdown Summary**: End-of-build summary shows top 4 time-consuming steps and percentages for build optimization insights
  - **Phase Headers**: Major build phases now display with clear `═══` separator lines and emojis for visual clarity

- **AppSync Resolvers Extracted to Nested Stack for Improved Template Modularity**
  - Refactored main CloudFormation template by extracting 130 AppSync resources into new nested stack architecture
  - **Extracted Components**:
    - Created `nested/appsync/template.yaml` containing GraphQLSchema, AppSyncServiceRole, Lambda resolver functions, LogGroups, DataSources, and Resolvers
    - Moved related Lambda functions from `src/lambda/` to `nested/appsync/src/lambda/` with colocated template definitions
    - Relocated GraphQL schema from `src/api/` to `nested/appsync/src/api/`
  - **Main Template Optimization**: Reduced resource count by keeping only core infrastructure (GraphQLApi, GraphQLApiLogGroup, AppSyncCwlRole, WAF resources, background worker functions)
  - **Build System Integration**: Updated `publish.py` to build nested stack in parallel with patterns
  - **Impact**: Main template now more manageable and faster to navigate, nested stack enables modular development of AppSync resources, parallel builds reduce overall build time

- **Consolidated Nested Stack Directory Structure**
  - Moved `options/bda-lending-project` and `options/bedrockkb` into `nested/` directory for simplified project organization
  - All CloudFormation nested stacks now located in single `nested/` directory alongside `appsync`, `bda-lending-project`, and `bedrockkb`
  - Updated build system to build only two categories concurrently (nested + patterns) instead of three (nested + patterns + options)
  - **Breaking Change**: Directory paths changed - `options/` → `nested/`. Existing work-in-progress branches will have merge conflicts in directory structure.


### Fixed

- **Fixed page_indices Reset Bug in Multi-Section Documents**
  - Fixed issue where all sections in document packets had page_indices starting from 0 instead of their actual position in the original document by pre-calculating indices during classification with access to global minimum page ID and storing in section.attributes for extraction step to use

- **Metering Table Added Requests**
  - Added requests count to bedrock metering data to track API request metrics
  
- **IDP CLI Stack Parameter Preservation During Updates**
  - Fixed bug where `idp-cli deploy` command was resetting ALL stack parameters to their default values during updates, even when users only intended to change specific parameters


### Upgrade Notes

- **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Upgrading from v0.4.11 or earlier**
  - **Complete all pending HITL workflows before upgrading**: Any documents waiting in SageMaker A2I human review loops will be orphaned as A2I resources are deleted during the upgrade
  - **Re-enable HITL after upgrade**: If you previously had `EnableHITL=true` CloudFormation parameter, you must now enable HITL through the Configuration page in the Web UI (Assessment & HITL Configuration → Enable HITL)
  - **User migration**: Existing Cognito users will need to be assigned to Admin or Reviewer groups for HITL access

## [0.4.10]

### Added

- **Enhanced Evaluation Reports with Granular Field Comparison Details (sticker-eval v0.1.4)**
  - Integrated sticker-eval v0.1.4's fine-grain field comparison feature providing detailed nested object match information alongside aggregate scores
  - **Nested Field Details**: For complex attributes (objects, arrays), reports now show individual field-by-field comparisons in addition to aggregate rollup scores
  - **Interactive Report Controls**: 
    - 🔍 "Show Only Unmatched" button to filter and display only problematic fields for focused debugging
    - ➕➖ Expand/Collapse All buttons to control nested detail visibility across the entire report
    - Expandable `<details>` sections for each attribute with nested comparisons
  - **Visual Enhancements**: Aggregate scores clearly marked with blue styling and "(aggregate)" annotation, color-coded rows (green for matched, red for unmatched), HTML tables with field paths and comparison results
  - **JSON Report Structure**: Full `field_comparison_details` array preserved in JSON output for programmatic analysis and consumption by analytics tools
  - **Benefits**: Quickly identify which specific nested fields cause aggregate score drops, compact problem view focusing on unmatched rows, complete diagnostic context with both high-level and granular perspectives

- **BDA / IDP Sync Feature for Pattern-1 Blueprint Synchronization**
  - Added bidirectional synchronization between BDA (Bedrock Data Automation) blueprints and IDP custom document classes
  - **Key Capabilities**: Automatic blueprint creation from IDP classes, automatic IDP class creation from BDA blueprints, intelligent change detection using DeepDiff, automatic cleanup of orphaned blueprints
  - **Sync Process**: Discovery configurations automatically trigger blueprint updates in BDA projects via `sync_bda_idp_resolver` Lambda function
  - **Schema Transformation**: Converts between IDP JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) and BDA blueprint format (draft-07) while preserving semantic meaning
  - **Important Limitations**: AWS managed blueprints excluded from sync, nested objects within objects not supported by BDA, nested arrays within object definitions not supported
  - **Best Practices**: Use flattened schema structures, place arrays only at top-level, validate schema structure before sync, monitor sync results for partial failures
  - **Use Cases**: Maintain consistency between IDP configuration and BDA blueprints, automatically propagate configuration changes, streamline document class management across both systems

- **Separate Pricing Configuration and Management UI**
  - Pricing configuration separated from general IDP configuration into dedicated system
  - New `config_library/pricing.yaml` file with centralized pricing for all AWS services (Textract, Bedrock, BDA, Lambda, SageMaker)
  - New "Pricing" page in Web UI for managing service pricing with:
    - Edit pricing for individual APIs and units (e.g., `bedrock/us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` → `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`)
    - Import/Export pricing configurations (JSON/YAML)
  - Used for cost estimation and reporting across all document processing workflows

- **Enhanced Document Pages Editor for Pattern-2 and Pattern-3**
  - Replaced confusing "View/Edit Data" button with intuitive "View Page Text" and "Edit Pages" workflow mirroring the Document Sections panel pattern
  - New modal editor with split-pane layout displaying plain text (left) and live markdown preview (right) - no more raw JSON visible to users
  - Added ability to reset page classifications to force reclassification and edit page text content with immediate S3 saves to prevent data loss
  - Implemented "Save & Process Changes" workflow for selective reprocessing - class resets trigger section removal and reclassification, text modifications trigger re-extraction while preserving sections
  - Resolves #164

## [0.4.8]

### Added

- **Section Data Download Feature for Document Results Export**
  - Added compact "Download" dropdown button in Document Sections panel for exporting section processing results
  - **Two Download Options**: 
    - "Download Data" - Downloads prediction results from OutputBucket (always available)
    - "Download Baseline" - Downloads baseline/ground truth data from EvaluationBaselineBucket (only shown when baseline exists)

- **Configuration Library Import Feature for Enhanced Configuration Management**
  - Added Configuration Library browser enabling users to import pre-configured document processing workflows directly from the solution's configuration library
  - **Dual Import Options**: Users can now choose between importing from local files (existing) or from the Configuration Library (new)
  - **Pattern-Aware Filtering**: Automatically displays only configurations compatible with the currently deployed pattern (Pattern 1, 2, or 3)
  - **README Preview**: When available, displays markdown-formatted README documentation before importing to help users understand configuration purpose and features

- **Test Studio Interactive Charts and Document Analysis Enhancements**
  - **Interactive Score Distribution Charts**: Replaced CloudScape chart with native Recharts implementation featuring dual chart support (Bar Chart and Line Chart options with dropdown selector), native interactivity with built-in click events that open document details modal, and optimized layout with improved margins, labels, and space utilization
  - **Lowest Scoring Documents Analysis**: Enhanced TestResults with table showing documents with lowest weighted overall scores, TestComparison with cross-test comparison of problematic documents, user-configurable count dropdown (5, 10, 20, or 50 documents), side-by-side T1 vs T2 comparison format for easy analysis, and clickable document links for direct navigation to document viewer
  - **UI/UX Improvements**: Compact table styling with reduced spacing and improved readability, left-aligned content for better text alignment of document IDs, consistent design matching existing CloudScape design system, and responsive layout where charts adapt to container width

  - Test set immediately available in Test Studio UI with complete ground truth for benchmarking extraction accuracy
  - Version controlled via CloudFormation property - skips re-download on stack updates unless version changes

### Fixed

- **Bedrock OCR Image Resizing Regression - Partial Dimension Configuration Support**
  - Fixed critical regression where configuring only `target_width` (without `target_height`) disabled all image resizing, causing Bedrock OCR to fail with "length limit exceeded" errors
  - **Root Cause**: OCR service used `and` condition requiring both dimensions, rejecting partial configs and sending full-resolution images that exceeded model input limits
  - **Solution**: Implemented aspect-ratio-preserving single-dimension resizing that calculates missing dimension from actual image aspect ratio

- **Test Studio Bug Fixes**
  - Fixed TestSets manual upload issues

- **Agentic Extraction Prompt Caching** - [GitHub PR #156](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/pull/156)
  - Removed additional cachepoints to prevent prompt caching conflicts in agentic extraction

- **GovCloud S3 Vectors Service Principal Deployment Failure** - [GitHub Issue #159](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/159)
  - Fixed CloudFormation deployment failure in GovCloud regions caused by S3 Vectors service not being available
  - **Root Cause**: KMS key policy referenced `indexing.s3vectors.${AWS::URLSuffix}` service principal which doesn't exist in GovCloud (us-gov-west-1, us-gov-east-1)

## [0.4.7]

### Added

- **MCP Integration Cross-Region Support for QuickSuite Integration**
  - Added cross-region support for QuickSuite integration enabling MCP connectivity across multiple AWS regions: us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-2

### Fixed

- **Stack deployment failure due to MCP Integration IAM Permissions - [GitHub Issue #154](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/154)**
  - Fixed missing permissions in AgentCoreGatewayManagerFunctionRole by creating the AgentCoreGateway execution role explicitly in the CloudFormation template instead of dynamically in the Lambda function

- **Post-Processing Lambda Hook Compression Handling - [GitHub Issue #155](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/155)**
  - Added intermediate decompression lambda to handle document decompression before invoking custom post-processing lambdas
  - **Root Cause**: After introducing document compression, the post-processing lambda hook was receiving compressed documents in the EventBridge payload, forcing external lambdas to import `idp_common` package and handle decompression manually
  - **Solution**: New `PostProcessingDecompressor` lambda function intercepts EventBridge events, decompresses documents using `Document.load_document()`, and invokes custom post-processors with decompressed payload
  - **Benefits**: Maintains backward compatibility, eliminates external dependencies (no `idp_common` import needed), keeps compression/decompression logic encapsulated within IDP stack, minimal performance impact (<1s latency)

- **Enhanced Bedrock Error Handling for Agent Companion Chat**
  - Implemented robust error handling system for Bedrock API errors in Agent Companion Chat feature with automatic retry and graceful degradation
  - **Automatic Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Configured boto3 with adaptive retry mode (3 attempts) and exponential back-off to prevent service overload
  - **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Created `BedrockErrorMessageHandler` to convert technical errors into clear, actionable messages for service unavailable (503), throttling (429), access denied (403), validation errors (400), timeouts (408), and quota exceeded scenarios
  - **Sub-Agent Error Handling**: When sub-agents (Analytics, Error Analyzer, Code Intelligence) encounter Bedrock errors, the orchestrator continues gracefully without crashing, only displaying the first error to avoid duplicates while allowing other sub-agents to complete

- **GovCloud Template Generation - Missing AppSync and MCP Resource Removal**
  - Fixed CloudFormation deployment error "Unresolved resource dependencies [DeleteDocumentResolverFunction]" when deploying GovCloud templates
  - **Test Studio Resources Added (36 resources)**: Added all Test Studio Lambda functions, AppSync resolvers, data sources, and supporting infrastructure to removal list (DeleteTestsResolver, TestRunnerResolver, TestResultsResolver, TestSetResolver, and all related functions, queues, and policies)
  - **MCP/AgentCore Gateway Resources Added (7 resources)**: Added MCP integration resources that depend on Cognito UserPool to removal list (AgentCoreAnalyticsLambdaFunction, AgentCoreGatewayManagerFunction, AgentCoreGatewayExecutionRole, AgentCoreGateway, ExternalAppClient)
  - **MCP Outputs Removed (8 outputs)**: Removed MCP-related outputs that reference deleted resources (MCPServerEndpoint, MCPClientId, MCPClientSecret, MCPUserPool, MCPTokenURL, MCPAuthorizationURL, DynamoDBAgentTableName, DynamoDBAgentTableConsoleURL)
  - **EnableMCP Default Changed**: Set `EnableMCP` parameter default to 'false' for GovCloud since MCP integration requires Cognito authentication infrastructure
  - **Impact**: GovCloud templates now deploy successfully without dependency errors, maintaining core document processing functionality in headless mode

## [0.4.6]

### Added

- **New State-Of-The-Art LLM Model Support**
  - Added support for Amazon Nova 2 Lite model (`us.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`, `eu.amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`)
  - Added support for Claude Opus 4.5 model (`us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0`, `eu.anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0`)
  - Added support for Qwen 3 VL model (`qwen.qwen3-vl-235b-a22b`)
  - Available for configuration across all document processing steps

- **Test Studio for Comprehensive Test Management and Analysis**
  - Added unified web interface for managing test sets, running tests, and analyzing results directly from the UI
  - **Test Sets Tab**: Create and manage reusable test collections with three creation methods:
    - Pattern-based creation with file patterns to match existing data sets (Input Bucket and Test Set Bucket)
    - Zip upload with automatic extraction of `input/` and `baseline/` folder structure
  - **Test Executions Tab**: Unified interface combining test execution and results management:
    - Real-time status monitoring
    - Multi-select comparison for side-by-side test analysis
    - Integrated export and delete operations
  - **Key Features**: File structure validation, progress-aware status updates, cached metrics for improved performance, dual bucket support for flexible test organization
  - **Documentation**: Guide in `docs/test-studio.md` with architecture details and workflow examples

- **MCP Integration for External Application Access**
  - Added MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration enabling external applications (like Amazon Quick Suite) to access IDP analytics through AWS Bedrock AgentCore Gateway with secure OAuth 2.0 authentication
  - Implemented Analytics Agent with `search_genaiidp` tool for natural language queries of processed document data (statistics, trends, confidence scores, processing status)
  - Controlled by `EnableMCP` parameter (default: true); provides MCPServerEndpoint and authentication outputs for external application integration; documentation in `docs/mcp-integration.md`

- **Configurable Section Splitting Strategies for Enhanced Document Segmentation Control**
  - Added new `sectionSplitting` configuration option to control how classified pages are grouped into document sections
  - **Three Strategies Available**:
    - `disabled`: Entire document treated as single section with first detected class (simplest case)
    - `page`: One section per page preventing automatic joining of same-type documents (deterministic, solves Issue #146)
    - `llm_determined`: Uses LLM boundary detection with "Start"/"Continue" indicators (default, maintains existing behavior)
  - **Key Benefits**: Deterministic splitting for long documents with multiple same-type forms (e.g., multiple W-2s, multiple invoices), eliminates LLM boundary detection failures for critical government form processing, provides flexibility across simple to complex document scenarios
  - Resolves #146

### Changed


- **Improved Temperature and Top_P Parameter Logic for Deterministic Output**
  - Changed inference parameter selection logic to allow `temperature=0.0` for deterministic output (recommended by Anthropic and other model providers)
  - **New Logic**: Uses `top_p` only when it has a positive value (> 0); otherwise uses `temperature` including `temperature=0.0`
  - **Previous Logic**: Used `top_p` whenever `temperature=0.0`, preventing proper deterministic configuration
  - **Key Benefits**: Enables proper deterministic output with `temperature=0.0`, more intuitive parameter behavior, aligns with model provider best practices (Anthropic recommends `temperature=0` for consistent outputs)
  - **Affected Components**: Bedrock client (`lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/bedrock/client.py`), Agentic extraction service (`lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/extraction/agentic_idp.py`)
  - **Configuration Guidance**: Set `top_p: 0` to use `temperature` parameter; set `top_p` to positive value to override temperature
  - Set temperature to 0.0 in discovery config for deterministic discovery output (was previously set to 1.0)
  - Set top_p to 0.0 in all repo config files to force use of temperature setting by default.

- **Removed page image limit entirely across all IDP services**
  - removed image limits from multimodal inference steps (classification, extraction, assessment) following Amazon Bedrock API removal of image count restrictions. The system now processes all document pages without artificial truncation, with info logging to track image counts for monitoring purposes.
  - Resolves #147

- **Knowledge Base Vector Store Default Changed to S3 Vectors**
  - Changed default `KnowledgeBaseVectorStore` from `OPENSEARCH_SERVERLESS` to `S3_VECTORS` for cost-optimized deployments
  - S3 Vectors provides 40-60% lower storage costs with sub-second latency suitable for most use cases
  - OpenSearch Serverless remains available for applications requiring sub-millisecond query performance
  - No action required for existing deployments - only affects new stack deployments

### Fixed

  - Fixed UI error banner "failed to get document details - please try again later" appearing when orphaned list entries exist (list# items without corresponding doc# items in DynamoDB tracking table)
  - **Root Cause**: When a document had a list entry but no corresponding document record, the error would trigger UI banner and prevent display of all documents in the same time shard
  - **Solution**: Enhanced error handling to gracefully handle missing documents - now only shows error banner if ALL documents fail to load, not just one
  - **Enhanced Debugging**: Added detailed console logging with full PK/SK information for both list entries and expected document entries to facilitate cleanup of orphaned records
  - **User Impact**: All valid documents now display correctly even when orphaned list entries exist; debugging information available in browser console for identifying problematic entries

  - Leverages the Strands Agent framework with iterative validation loops and automatic error correction to deliver schema compliance
  - Provides structured output through Pydantic models with built-in validators, automatic retry handling, and superior handling of complex nested structures and date standardization
  - Includes sample notebooks and configuration assets demonstrating agentic extraction for Pattern-2 lending documents
  - Programmatic access available via `structured_output` function in `lib/idp_common_pkg/idp_common/extraction/agentic_idp.py`
  - Currently this is an experimental feature. Future extensibility includes UI-based validation customization, code generation, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for external data enrichment during extraction

- **IDP CLI - Command Line Interface for Batch Document Processing**
  - Added CLI tool (`idp_cli/`) for programmatic batch document processing and stack management
  - **Key Features**: Deploy/update/delete CloudFormation stacks, process and reprocess documents from local directories or S3 URIs, live progress monitoring with rich terminal UI, download processing results locally, validate manifests before processing, generate manifests from directories with automatic baseline matching
  - **Selective Reprocessing**: New `rerun-inference` command to reprocess documents from specific pipeline steps (classification or extraction) while leveraging existing OCR data for cost/time optimization
  - **Evaluation Framework**: Workflow for accuracy testing including initial processing, manual validation, baseline creation, and automated evaluation with detailed metrics
  - **Analytics Integration**: Query aggregated results via Athena SQL or use Agent Analytics in Web UI for visual analysis

  - **Configuration**: Enable by adding `{EXTRACTION_RESULTS}` placeholder to `task_prompt` in config.yaml
  - **Benefits**: Context-aware summaries referencing extracted values, improved accuracy and quality, better extraction-summary alignment

### Changed


- **Containerized Pattern-2 deployment pipeline** that builds and pushes all Lambda images via CodeBuild using the new Dockerfile, plus automated ECR cleanup and tests.
  - Lambda docker image deployments have a 10 GB image size limit compared to the 250 MB zip limit of regular deployment. This however doesn't allow for viewing the code in the AWS console.
    The change was introduced to accommodate the increased package size of introducing Strands into the package dependencies.

### Fixed
- **Discovery function times out when processing large documents.**
  - increase lambda discovery processor timeout to 900s
- **Corrected baseline directory structure documentation in evaluation.md**
  - Fixed incorrect baseline structure showing flat `.json` files instead of proper directory hierarchy
  - Updated to correct structure: `<document-name>/sections/1/result.json`
  - Reorganized document for better logical flow and user experience
- **GovCloud Template Generation - Removed GraphQLApi References** - #82
  - Fixed invalid GovCloud template generation where ProcessChanges AppSync resources were not being removed, causing "Fn::GetAtt references undefined resource GraphQLApi" errors
  - Updated `scripts/generate_govcloud_template.py` to remove all ProcessChanges-related resources and extend AppSync parameter cleanup to all pattern stacks
  - Fixed InvalidClientTokenId validation error by ensuring CloudFormation client uses the correct region when validating templates (commercial vs GovCloud)
- **Enhanced Processing Flow Visualization for Disabled Steps**
  - Fixed UX issue where disabled processing steps (when `summarization.enabled: false` or `assessment.enabled: false` in configuration) appeared visually identical to active steps in the "View Processing Flow" display
  - **Key Benefit**: Users can now immediately see which steps are actually processing data vs. steps that execute but skip processing based on configuration settings, preventing confusion about whether summarization or assessment ran
  - Limitation: the new visual indicators are driven from the current config, which may have been altered since the document was processed. We will address this in a later release. See Issue #86.

### Known Issues
- **GovCloud Deployments fail, due to lack of ARM support for CodeBuild. Fix targeted for next release.**

### Fixed

- **Problem with setting correctly formatted WAF IPv4 CIDR range** - #73

- **Duplicate Step Functions Executions on Document Reprocess - [GitHub Issue #66](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/accelerated-intelligent-document-processing-on-aws/issues/66)**
  - Eliminated duplicate workflow executions when reprocessing large documents (>40MB, 500+ pages)
  - **Root Cause**: S3 `copy_object` operations were triggering multiple "Object Created" events for large files, causing `queue_sender` to create duplicate document entries and workflow executions
  - **Solution**: Refactored `reprocess_document_resolver` to directly create fresh Document objects and queue to SQS, completely bypassing S3 event notifications
  - **Benefits**: Eliminates unnecessary S3 copy operations (cost savings)

  - If the prompt contains a `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}` placeholder, keep the current behavior (insert image at placeholder)
  - If the prompt does NOT contain a `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}` placeholder, do NOT attach the image at all
  - Previously, if the (classification or extraction) prompt did NOT contain a `{DOCUMENT_IMAGE}` placeholder, the image was appended at the end of the content array anyway
- **Modified default assessment prompt for token efficiency**
